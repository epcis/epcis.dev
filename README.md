## Background
[EPCIS.dev](https://epcis.dev) was created by [Nathan Clevenger](https://github.com/nathanclevenger) to simplify the experience of capturing end-to-end supply chain visibility in the cloud using the [next-generation](https://graphdl.org) of [transformational](https://blog.cloudflare.com/durable-objects-easy-fast-correct-choose-three/) [edge](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works/) [technologies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pub-sub/).

## Sponsor
[Driv.ly](https://driv.ly) is a simple API to buy & sell cars online, funded by some of the [biggest names](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak) in [automotive](https://fontinalis.com/team/#bill-ford) and [finance & insurance](https://www.detroit.vc)

We're building our entire infrastructure on [GraphDL](https://graphdl.org), [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works/), and [Durable Objects](https://blog.cloudflare.com/durable-objects-easy-fast-correct-choose-three/).  If you're as passionate about these transformational technologies as we are, we'd love for you to join our rapidly-growing team.
