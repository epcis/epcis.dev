# Understanding the Value of EPCIS for Managing Supply Chain Complexity

Managing a supply chain is no easy feat. It is a complex process that involves multiple parties such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and end customers. Each of these parties plays a crucial role in the chain, and any disruptions can lead to significant losses.

To manage the complexity of the supply chain, businesses have started to adopt new technologies such as the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS). EPCIS is a standard that enables organizations to track, trace, and share information across the supply chain in a standardized manner.

In this article, we will discuss the value of EPCIS for managing supply chain complexity, how it works, and its benefits.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard that provides a standardized way of sharing information across the supply chain. It was developed by GS1, a global standards organization, and is used to track and trace goods as they move through the supply chain.

At its core, EPCIS provides a standardized way of tracking, tracing, and sharing information about who, what, when, where, why, and how products move throughout the supply chain.

## How does EPCIS work?

EPCIS uses electronic product codes (EPCs) to identify and track products as they move through the supply chain. EPCs are unique identifiers that are assigned to each product and are used to track the product's movement through the chain.

As the products are scanned at various points in the supply chain, the information is recorded in the EPCIS system. This information includes data such as the location of the product, the time it was scanned, and who scanned it.

The information recorded in the EPCIS system is then shared with other parties in the supply chain. This means that the supplier can access information about the products they have supplied, the manufacturer can access information about the products they have produced, and the distributor can access information about the products they have distributed.

This standardized sharing of information allows all parties in the supply chain to have visibility into the movement of products, which helps to reduce delays, minimize losses, and improve overall efficiency.

## Benefits of EPCIS

1. Improved visibility: By using EPCIS, businesses can have visibility into the entire supply chain. This means that they can identify any delays or problems and take corrective action before they become a major issue.

2. Traceability: EPCIS allows businesses to trace products back to their source. This is particularly important in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, where traceability is critical for ensuring the safety and quality of the products.

3. Increased efficiency: EPCIS helps to increase efficiency by reducing delays and minimizing losses. By having visibility into the supply chain, businesses can optimize their processes and improve overall efficiency.

4. Accountability: EPCIS promotes accountability among all parties in the supply chain. By tracking and sharing information about the movement of products, it becomes easier to identify where any problems have occurred and who is responsible.

5. Better customer service: EPCIS can help businesses to provide better customer service by providing real-time information about the products. This means that businesses can provide accurate delivery times and keep customers informed about the status of their orders.

6. Compliance: EPCIS helps businesses to comply with regulations and standards such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By tracking and sharing information in a standardized manner, businesses can ensure that they are meeting their regulatory obligations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS provides a standardized way of tracking, tracing, and sharing information across the supply chain. By using EPCIS, businesses can improve their visibility, increase efficiency, promote accountability, and comply with regulatory standards.

As supply chains become increasingly complex, EPCIS is becoming more and more important. It enables businesses to manage the complexity of the supply chain by providing a standardized way of sharing information across all parties.

If you are looking to improve the efficiency and visibility of your supply chain, then EPCIS is definitely worth considering. It is a powerful tool that can help you to optimize your processes and reduce losses, ultimately leading to increased profitability and customer satisfaction.
