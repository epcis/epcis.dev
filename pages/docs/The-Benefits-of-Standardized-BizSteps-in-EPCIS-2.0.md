# The Benefits of Standardized BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0

As businesses and organizations rely more heavily on technology to manage their supply chains, the importance of effective information management becomes increasingly apparent. The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard developed by EPC Global is a framework for exchanging information about products and related business processes in the supply chain in a standardized format.

Within the framework of EPCIS, there is a specific set of standard business steps or 'BizSteps' that are involved in the management of supply chain processes. Standardized BizSteps refer to a common set of business process descriptions that are used across different organizations and industries. In EPCIS 2.0, standardized BizSteps are a key component of the framework as they improve the interoperability, consistency, and efficiency of data exchange between different organizations and systems.

In this blog post, we'll discuss the benefits of standardized BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, and how they help businesses to better manage their supply chain operations.

## Increased Interoperability

One of the main benefits of standardized BizSteps is improved interoperability between different organizations and systems. When multiple organizations are involved in a supply chain, it's important that they can exchange information with each other seamlessly. Without standardized BizSteps, each organization might describe their supply chain processes differently, which can lead to confusion and slow down the exchange of information.

Standardized BizSteps have a set of common process descriptions that all organizations can agree on. This means that when two organizations are exchanging information about their supply chain processes, they can be confident that they are talking about the same process.

This increased interoperability can help to speed up the exchange of information between different organizations, reducing the time it takes to complete supply chain processes such as shipping, receiving, and tracking products.

## Consistency in Data Exchange

Standardized BizSteps also improve the consistency of data exchange between different organizations. When each organization has their own terms and processes for managing supply chain data, it can be difficult to ensure that the data is consistent across all organizations involved in the process.

With standardized BizSteps, organizations can be confident that they are using the same terms and processes, which means that the data exchanged between them is more consistent. This can help to reduce errors and ensure that all organizations have a clear understanding of the supply chain processes.

For example, if one organization uses the term "warehouse" to describe a storage facility, and another organization uses the term "distribution center," there could be confusion when exchanging information about the location of a product. With standardized BizSteps, both organizations would use the same term, reducing the chance of confusion.

## Improved Analytics

Standardized BizSteps help to improve the quality of supply chain data, which in turn leads to improved analytics. When information is exchanged consistently and accurately between different organizations, it's easier to analyze the data to identify trends, optimize processes, and make better business decisions.

Improved analytics can help businesses to identify bottlenecks, track shipments more accurately, and optimize their inventory management. This can lead to significant cost savings and improved efficiency in supply chain operations.

## Flexibility in Implementation

Despite the standardization of BizSteps, EPCIS 2.0 allows for flexibility in implementation. Organizations are free to customize their implementation of BizSteps to meet their specific needs. For example, they can add additional steps to existing BizSteps or create new BizSteps altogether.

This flexibility allows businesses to adapt their supply chain processes to changing market conditions and organizational needs. It also enables them to differentiate themselves from their competitors by creating their own unique supply chain processes.

## Improved Customer Service

Standardized BizSteps help organizations to provide better customer service by improving the efficiency and accuracy of supply chain processes. When organizations are able to exchange information quickly and accurately, they can provide customers with better tracking and delivery information, reducing the likelihood of delays and improving overall customer satisfaction.

This improved customer service can help businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, and improve customer loyalty.

## Conclusion

Standardized BizSteps are a key component of EPCIS 2.0, and offer numerous benefits to businesses and organizations involved in supply chain management. Increased interoperability, consistency in data exchange, improved analytics, implementation flexibility, and improved customer service are just a few of the advantages that standardized BizSteps can provide.

Adopting standardized BizSteps can help businesses to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving supply chain landscape, where efficiency and accuracy are more important than ever. By working towards standardization in supply chain management, businesses can improve their supply chain operations, reduce costs, and deliver better customer service.
