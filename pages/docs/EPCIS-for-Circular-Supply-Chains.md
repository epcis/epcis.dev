# EPCIS for Circular Supply Chains

The circular economy is an economic model that aims to create sustainable growth by decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, through the use of renewable resources and circular processes. In this model, waste is reduced, reused, and recycled to create a closed-loop system where resources are continuously re-used. EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a standard that enables the sharing of information about products and their movements through the supply chain. EPCIS can be used to facilitate the implementation of circular supply chains, where products and materials move in a closed loop.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is an open technology standard developed by GS1 (Global Standards One). The standard enables real-time sharing of information about products and their movements through the supply chain. The information is stored in a standardized format that can be easily accessed by all stakeholders in the supply chain.

The EPCIS standard defines a set of messages that can be exchanged between different systems in the supply chain. These messages are used to capture and share relevant data about products, such as their location, condition, and status.

EPCIS is designed to be used in conjunction with other GS1 standards, such as the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN). Together, these standards enable the creation of a digital representation of the physical supply chain.

## What is a Circular Supply Chain?

A circular supply chain is a closed-loop system where products and materials are continuously reused, reducing waste and increasing resource efficiency. In a circular supply chain, products are designed to be easily disassembled and their components are recycled or reused in the production of new products.

In a circular supply chain, products and materials are tracked and monitored using EPCIS. By sharing information about the movements and status of products, stakeholders can ensure that products are reused and recycled as efficiently as possible.

Circular supply chains have several benefits, including:

- Reducing waste and pollution
- Increasing resource efficiency
- Creating new business opportunities
- Reducing reliance on finite resources

## How can EPCIS Facilitate Circular Supply Chains?

EPCIS can facilitate the implementation of circular supply chains by providing stakeholders with real-time information about the movements and status of products. By tracking products through the supply chain, stakeholders can identify opportunities for reuse and recycling.

EPCIS can capture and share data about a wide range of product attributes, including:

- Product location and movement
- Condition and status
- Product composition and ingredients
- Production data

By sharing this information, stakeholders can identify opportunities for product reuse and recycling. For example, a manufacturer may be able to reuse a product's components in the production of a new product, rather than sourcing new materials.

EPCIS can also facilitate the sharing of information between different systems in the supply chain. This allows stakeholders to coordinate their activities more effectively, resulting in a more efficient and effective circular supply chain.

## Case Study: The Circular Supply Chain for Mobile Phones

The mobile phone industry is an excellent example of how EPCIS can be used to facilitate a circular supply chain. The industry has recognized the need to reduce waste and increase resource efficiency, and many companies are already implementing circular supply chain processes.

In the mobile phone industry, EPCIS is used to track the movements and status of phones through the supply chain. By sharing information about the condition and status of phones, stakeholders can identify opportunities for repair and refurbishment.

Many companies are now offering repair and refurbishment services for mobile phones. By extending the life of mobile phones, these companies reduce waste and conserve resources.

EPCIS also enables the tracking and sharing of information about the materials used in mobile phone production. By tracking the movement of materials throughout the supply chain, stakeholders can identify opportunities for recycling and reuse.

## Conclusion

EPCIS is a powerful tool for facilitating circular supply chains. By tracking products through the supply chain and sharing relevant data, stakeholders can identify opportunities for reuse and recycling. This can lead to significant reductions in waste and resource consumption, while also creating new business opportunities.

The mobile phone industry is an excellent example of how EPCIS can be used to facilitate a circular supply chain. Many companies in the industry are already implementing circular supply chain processes, and EPCIS is playing a key role in this transformation.

As the adoption of circular supply chains continues to grow, we can expect to see more companies embracing EPCIS as a tool for facilitating sustainable growth and reducing waste.
