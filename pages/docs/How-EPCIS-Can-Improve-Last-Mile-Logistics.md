# How EPCIS Can Improve Last Mile Logistics

Last mile logistics is one of the most challenging aspects of the supply chain management process. It involves the delivery of goods from the distribution center to the final destination or the end customer. It is also the point where most of the supply chain costs are incurred, and the difference between an efficient and inefficient last mile delivery can impact the cost of goods sold and the overall customer experience.

Several factors influence the efficiency of last mile logistics, such as the number of packages, delivery routes, traffic conditions, and the availability of the delivery staff. In recent years, with the rise of e-commerce, demands for faster delivery, and increased customer expectations around tracking and transparency, supply chain stakeholders have shown growing interest in implementing new technologies to optimize last mile logistics tasks.

One such technology option is Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS), an open standard designed to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility through the sharing and exchange of data between different parties involved in the supply chain management process. 

In this blog post, we will explore how EPCIS can improve last mile logistics and support businesses' overall supply chain management strategies.

## Overview of EPCIS 

Before we dive into the benefits of EPCIS, letâ€™s briefly discuss what it is and how it works. The Electronic Product Code (EPC) is an alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a product throughout the supply chain. The EPC Information Service (EPCIS) allows supply chain stakeholders to track products using their EPCs by sharing data with each other.

The data exchanged through EPCIS includes information such as the location, time, and status of the product. This information can be accessed by authorized parties at any point in the supply chain, providing complete visibility and traceability. EPCIS uses a standardized language called the EPCIS Event Data Model, which enables communication across different supply chain management systems.

## Support for Last Mile Delivery

EPCIS can support last mile delivery in several ways. Firstly, it enables end-to-end traceability of the products throughout the supply chain, including the last mile delivery. This means that supply chain stakeholders can monitor the entire delivery process and be alerted to any issues or bottlenecks that may occur. For example, if a package is delayed due to traffic or weather conditions, the delivery staff can update the EPCIS system with this information, and the supply chain stakeholders can take the necessary steps to mitigate the impact.

Secondly, EPCIS allows for real-time status updates, providing greater visibility and control over the last mile delivery process. This information is invaluable in addressing any potential issues before they become major problems. For example, if a package is damaged in transit, the delivery staff can update its status in the EPCIS system, allowing the supply chain stakeholders to initiate a replacement shipment to meet the customer's expectations.

Thirdly, EPCIS enables supply chain stakeholders to monitor and optimize last mile delivery routes. This allows for better planning and scheduling, ensuring that delivery staff can efficiently navigate the delivery routes without wasting time or encountering traffic or other obstacles. By optimizing delivery routes, businesses can reduce the number of delivery trucks on the road, which can reduce fuel consumption, minimize wear and tear on vehicles, and ultimately reduce the overall cost of last mile delivery.

## Improved Customer Experience

Along with providing better visibility and control over last mile delivery, EPCIS can also improve the customer experience. In addition to tracking packages through EPCIS, customers can receive real-time updates on the status of their deliveries, including estimated delivery times and any potential delays. This information increases transparency and builds trust between the business and the customer.

EPCIS can also enable businesses to offer more flexible and convenient delivery options to customers, such as same-day or on-demand delivery. By providing these options, businesses can differentiate themselves from competitors and improve customer loyalty and repeat purchases.

## Increasing Efficiency and Reducing Costs

One of the most significant benefits of implementing EPCIS in last mile logistics is the potential for increased efficiency and cost reduction. With improved visibility and control over the delivery process, businesses can reduce the number of undeliverable packages or incorrect deliveries, which can be both costly and time-consuming to rectify. By optimizing delivery routes and minimizing delays, businesses can reduce labor and transportation costs.

EPCIS can also support supply chain stakeholders in identifying and addressing inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the last mile delivery process. For example, if a particular delivery location consistently experiences delays, EPCIS can enable supply chain stakeholders to identify the issue and take the necessary steps to optimize the delivery process.

## Conclusion

In summary, last mile delivery is a critical aspect of the supply chain management process that can significantly impact the overall customer experience and the cost of goods sold. EPCIS provides businesses with a tool to optimize the last mile delivery process by providing end-to-end visibility, real-time status updates, and delivery route optimization.

By supporting flexibility, convenience, and transparency for customers, EPCIS can help businesses differentiate themselves from competitors and increase customer loyalty. Furthermore, the increased efficiency and cost reduction potential make implementing EPCIS in last mile logistics a strategic decision for businesses looking to improve their overall supply chain management strategies.
