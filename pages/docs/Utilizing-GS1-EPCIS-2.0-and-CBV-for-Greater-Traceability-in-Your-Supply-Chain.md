# Utilizing GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Greater Traceability in Your Supply Chain

As the world becomes increasingly globalized, the need for supply chains that operate efficiently and with the utmost transparency becomes all the more pressing. Businesses today are facing mounting pressure to improve their supply chain sustainability and security, as well as ensure the safety and quality of their products.

One of the most promising solutions to these challenges is the adoption of GS1 Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), two interconnected standards developed by the global standards organization GS1. 

In this blog post, we'll take a deep dive into GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, exploring their benefits and how they can be used to enhance supply chain traceability.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

GS1 EPCIS is a standard that enables businesses to capture and share real-time information about the movement and status of products as they move through the supply chain. This information can include data related to product identification, location, temperature, and more.

EPCIS is based on a unique identification system called the Electronic Product Code (EPC). Each EPC is a globally unique identifier that can be attached to a product or packaging at the item level. This allows for granular tracking of products throughout the supply chain.

The latest version of the standard, GS1 EPCIS 2.0, was released in 2016 and includes a number of significant improvements over previous versions. One of the key features of EPCIS 2.0 is its ability to handle complex event data, such as multiple events associated with a single product or events with multiple locations and participants.

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is built on a service-oriented architecture (SOA), which enables seamless integration with other systems in the supply chain. This means that product data can be easily shared between different businesses, providing greater visibility into the movement of products and reducing the risk of errors and delays.

## What is Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is another GS1 standard that provides a common set of terms and definitions for use in product information systems. It includes a standardized vocabulary for describing product characteristics, such as size, color, and weight, as well as location information, such as country of origin and manufacturing site.

CBV is designed to be used in conjunction with other GS1 standards, such as EPCIS and Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), to provide a comprehensive framework for product data management. By using a standardized vocabulary, businesses can ensure that all relevant stakeholders are using the same terminology and information, reducing confusion and improving data quality.

## Benefits of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

The adoption of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can provide a number of significant benefits for businesses, including:

### Greater Product Visibility

By implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, businesses can capture and share real-time information about the status and location of products as they move through the supply chain. This visibility can help to identify bottlenecks and delays, as well as provide valuable insights into product demand and usage patterns.

### Improved Product Safety and Quality

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can also be used to enhance product safety and quality by enabling businesses to track products from the point of origin to the point of consumption. This allows for better identification of the source of potential contaminants or quality issues, as well as more effective recall management in the event of a safety issue.

### Enhanced Supply Chain Sustainability

The granular tracking capabilities provided by EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can also help to improve supply chain sustainability. By tracking the movement of products from raw materials to finished goods, businesses can identify areas of waste and inefficiency and make targeted improvements to reduce their environmental footprint.

### Improved Collaboration and Communication

Finally, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help to improve collaboration and communication between businesses in the supply chain. By using a common vocabulary and sharing real-time data, businesses can reduce errors and delays and work together to solve problems as they arise.

## Use Cases for EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

So, how can businesses actually utilize EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to improve their supply chains? Here are a few examples:

### Food Traceability

The food industry is one of the most promising areas for the adoption of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. By using these standards, food producers can track products from the field to the grocery store shelf, providing greater visibility into the movement of food and enhancing food safety.

For example, if a shipment of lettuce is found to be contaminated with E.coli, EPCIS 2.0 can be used to quickly identify the source of the contamination and initiate a targeted recall. CBV can also be used to provide customers with more detailed information about the origin and characteristics of the lettuce, such as where it was grown and what kind of fertilizer was used.

### Pharmaceutical Tracking

The pharmaceutical industry is another area where EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can be utilized to enhance product safety and efficiency. By tracking the movement of prescription drugs from the manufacturer to the patient, businesses can identify potential issues with counterfeiting or diversion, as well as ensure that products are properly stored and handled.

### Logistics and Warehousing

Finally, logistics and warehousing businesses can benefit from the adoption of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. By tracking the movement of products within a warehouse or between different storage facilities, businesses can identify areas of waste or inefficiency and make targeted improvements to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

## Conclusion

In today's increasingly complex supply chain landscape, businesses need new tools and strategies to ensure that their products are safe, sustainable, and traceable. By adopting GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, businesses can vastly improve their product visibility and traceability, leading to better collaboration, communication, and overall supply chain efficiency.

Of course, implementing these standards requires an investment in technology and infrastructure, as well as a commitment to ongoing data quality and management. But for businesses that are willing to make this investment, the benefits are clear: improved product safety and sustainability, enhanced collaboration and communication, and a stronger, more resilient supply chain.
