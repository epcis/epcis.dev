# Common GS1 CBV Mistakes to Avoid

GS1 CBV, or Global Standard One Certified Barcode Verification, is the industry standard for barcode quality assurance. Correctly implementing GS1 CBV standards can help companies ensure that their barcodes will be readable throughout the supply chain, reducing errors and improving efficiency. However, there are several common mistakes that companies make when implementing GS1 CBV standards that can lead to problems with barcode quality. In this blog post, weâ€™ll take a look at some of the most common GS1 CBV mistakes and how to avoid them.

## 1. Not following GS1 guidelines for barcode size

One of the most common mistakes that companies make is not following the GS1 guidelines for barcode size. The size of a barcode is critical to its readability, and the GS1 guidelines are designed to ensure that barcodes are printed at a size that is appropriate for their intended use. If a barcode is printed too small or too large, it may not be readable by scanners, or it may be misread, leading to errors in the supply chain.

To avoid this mistake, companies should make sure that they follow the GS1 guidelines for barcode size. These guidelines specify the minimum and maximum sizes for different types of barcodes, and they also provide recommendations for the size of quiet zones (the empty spaces around the barcode). By following these guidelines, companies can ensure that their barcodes will be properly sized for their intended use.

## 2. Using incorrect barcode symbologies

Another common mistake that companies make is using incorrect barcode symbologies. Barcode symbologies refer to the different types of barcodes that are available, such as EAN-13, UPC-A, or Code 128. Each symbology has its own requirements for encoding data, and some symbologies are better suited for certain types of data or applications than others.

To avoid this mistake, companies should make sure that they use the correct barcode symbology for their application. The GS1 guidelines provide recommendations for which symbologies to use in different scenarios, and companies should follow these recommendations to ensure that their barcodes are readable and accurate.

## 3. Failing to verify barcodes before printing

One of the biggest mistakes that companies make is failing to verify their barcodes before printing them. Barcode verification involves testing the readability and accuracy of a barcode using specialized equipment. If barcodes are not properly verified before printing, errors may go undetected, resulting in unreadable or inaccurate barcodes that can cause problems in the supply chain.

To avoid this mistake, companies should invest in high-quality barcode verification equipment and make sure that all barcodes are properly verified before they are printed. By doing so, companies can catch errors before they become a problem and ensure that their barcodes are readable and accurate.

## 4. Ignoring environmental factors that can affect barcode quality

Barcode quality can be affected by a variety of environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and exposure to chemicals. Failure to take these factors into account can result in barcodes that are unreadable or inaccurate, leading to supply chain problems and lost revenue.

To avoid this mistake, companies should consider the environmental factors that may affect barcode quality and take steps to mitigate their impact. For example, barcodes that will be exposed to harsh chemicals may need to be printed on special materials or with special inks to ensure that they remain readable. Similarly, barcodes that will be exposed to extreme temperatures may need to be printed on materials that can withstand those temperatures.

## 5. Not properly maintaining barcode verification equipment

Finally, companies often make the mistake of not properly maintaining their barcode verification equipment. Barcode verification equipment is expensive, and failure to properly maintain it can result in reduced accuracy and reliability, leading to problems with barcode quality.

To avoid this mistake, companies should establish a regular maintenance schedule for their barcode verification equipment and make sure that it is properly maintained by trained technicians. By doing so, companies can extend the life of their equipment and ensure that it continues to provide accurate and reliable barcode verification.

In conclusion, implementing GS1 CBV standards can help companies ensure that their barcodes are readable and accurate throughout the supply chain, reducing errors and improving efficiency. However, there are several common mistakes that companies make when implementing GS1 CBV standards that can lead to problems with barcode quality. By following the guidelines outlined in this blog post and taking steps to avoid these common mistakes, companies can ensure that their barcodes are readable and accurate, improving supply chain efficiency and reducing errors.
