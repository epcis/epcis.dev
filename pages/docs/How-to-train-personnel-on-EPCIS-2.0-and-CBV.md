# How to Train Personnel on EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

As organizations continue to adopt and implement Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), there is a growing need to train personnel on how to use these technologies effectively. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are essential tools for facilitating transformation, leaner supply chains, and improved efficiency in multiple industries, but they can only be fully realized with a knowledgeable and trained workforce. This blog post will provide some tips on how to train personnel on EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to ensure they can successfully implement these technologies across the organization.

## Why Train Personnel on EPCIS 2.0 and CBV?

Before we delve into the specifics, it is essential to understand the significance of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for transformation. At its core, EPCIS 2.0 is a data-sharing standard that enables organizations to collect and share information about the movement and location of goods in a supply chain. CBV, on the other hand, provides a standardized set of terms that allow businesses to define their processes and communicate them effectively. Together, the two technologies enable organizations to:

- Reduce data silos and enable real-time visibility across the supply chain
- Streamline supply chain processes to improve efficiency and productivity
- Boost transparency and enable better decision-making
- Enhance collaboration between stakeholders across the supply chain

To achieve these benefits, personnel across the organization, from IT teams to operations and supply chain management teams, must understand how to use these technologies. Here are some tips on how to get started with training personnel on EPCIS 2.0 and CBV.

## Tips for Training Personnel on EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

### 1. Start with the basics

Before diving deep into EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, it is crucial to ensure personnel have a solid understanding of the underlying supply chain process. This understanding will enable them to understand how EPCIS 2.0 works and how CBV provides a standardized language to communicate these processes.

Ensure that personnel understand the fundamental concepts of supply chain management, including inventory management, order fulfillment, logistics, and transportation. This basic knowledge will serve as a foundation for more in-depth training on EPCIS 2.0 and CBV.

### 2. Highlight the benefits

It is essential to communicate the value of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to personnel. By highlighting the benefits, you can create buy-in from personnel and motivate them to learn and implement these technologies effectively.

Some common benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV include the ability to optimize business processes, reduce lead times, improve product quality, and enhance collaboration across supply chain stakeholders. It is crucial to communicate these benefits in a way that is relevant to individual personnel, demonstrating how these technologies can improve their day-to-day work and job satisfaction.

### 3. Provide hands-on training

While conceptual training is essential, it is often only useful when complemented with hands-on training. Hands-on training enables personnel to see how EPCIS 2.0 and CBV work in practice, which can help them understand the processes more effectively.

Consider setting up a simulation to help personnel understand how the technologies can be used in a real-world context. You could also provide access to a sandbox environment where personnel can experiment with EPCIS 2.0 and CBV on their own to gain practical experience.

### 4. Offer ongoing support

Even after personnel have completed their initial training, ongoing support is essential for ensuring they continue to use EPCIS 2.0 and CBV correctly. Consider setting up a help desk or providing access to training materials to enable personnel to ask questions, troubleshoot issues, and stay up to date with new updates or improvements to the technologies.

### 5. Provide cross-functional training

One of the benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is that they provide a standardized language for communicating across different teams and departments. Consider providing cross-functional training that enables personnel from various parts of the organization to understand how they can benefit from using these technologies.

This cross-functional training can be especially useful for breaking down silos and enabling personnel to collaborate more effectively across the supply chain. Cross-functional training should emphasize the "big picture" of how EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can benefit the organization as a whole, not just individual departments.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are essential for facilitating transformation and improving supply chain processes, but they can only be fully realized with a trained and knowledgeable workforce. Ensuring personnel understand the basics, highlighting the benefits, providing hands-on training, offering ongoing support, and providing cross-functional training are all key strategies for training personnel on these technologies effectively.

By providing effective training, organizations can unlock the full potential of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, enabling them to optimize supply chain processes, improve efficiency, reduce lead times, and enhance collaboration between stakeholders. Investing in training today is an investment in building a more agile and efficient supply chain for tomorrow.
