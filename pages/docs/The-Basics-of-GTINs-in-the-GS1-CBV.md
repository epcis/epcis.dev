# The Basics of GTINs in the GS1 CBV

The Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is a unique numeric identifier for products that is part of the GS1 system. GTINs are used to identify products in supply chains globally and are an essential element of the GS1 Core Business Vocabulary (CBV).

In this post, we will explore the basics of GTINs in the GS1 CBV and how they are used to ensure accurate identification and tracking of products across supply chains.

## What is a GTIN?

A GTIN is a unique 14-digit identification number that is assigned to a product by the manufacturer. It is used to identify individual products and their packaging, making it easier for retailers, distributors, and other partners in the supply chain to track and manage products.

There are four types of GTINs:

1. GTIN-12: This is a 12-digit number used for products sold in North America, typically on retail packages or consumer goods. It is also known as a UPC (Universal Product Code).

2. GTIN-13: This is a 13-digit number used for products sold outside North America, typically on retail packages or consumer goods. It is also known as an EAN (European Article Number).

3. GTIN-14: This is a 14-digit number used to identify shipping containers and pallets. It includes the GTIN-13 of the product it contains, plus a separate digit to identify the packaging level or trade item contained.

4. GTIN-8: This is an 8-digit number used for smaller products that require a compact barcode. It is commonly used for products sold in vending machines or for periodicals.

## How are GTINs used in the GS1 CBV?

The GS1 CBV is a set of standardized business terms and definitions that describe products, locations, and other key elements of supply chain operations. GTINs play a critical role in the CBV, as they provide a unique identifier for each product in the supply chain.

When a manufacturer assigns a GTIN to a product, they are also required to provide additional information about the product, such as its name, description, packaging dimensions, and weight. This information is used to create a standardized product description that can be shared across the entire supply chain.

The CBV also includes definitions for other key elements of the supply chain, such as locations, units of measure, and packaging levels. By standardizing these definitions, the CBV enables partners in the supply chain to understand and communicate with each other more effectively.

## Why are GTINs important in the supply chain?

GTINs are important in the supply chain for several reasons:

1. Accurate product identification: By assigning a unique GTIN to each product, manufacturers can ensure that their products are accurately identified and tracked throughout the supply chain. This helps to reduce errors and improve supply chain visibility.

2. Efficient supply chain operations: The use of standardized business terms and definitions, such as those included in the CBV, helps to streamline supply chain operations by eliminating confusion and miscommunication.

3. Improved product traceability: With accurate identification and tracking, it is easier to trace products through the supply chain in the event of a recall or other issue. This enables companies to take swift and effective action to protect consumers and their brand reputation.

## How are GTINs assigned?

GTINs are assigned by the manufacturer of the product. To obtain a GTIN, manufacturers must apply for a GS1 company prefix from their local GS1 member organization. This prefix is a unique identifier that is used to create GTINs for all of the products a company manufactures.

Once a company has a GS1 company prefix, they can assign GTINs to their products using the following process:

1. Determine the packaging level: GTINs are assigned at the packaging level, which is the level at which inventory is managed. For example, a company may assign GTINs to individual products, cases, and pallets.

2. Create the GTIN: The GTIN is created by combining the company prefix with a unique product number. The product number can be any number up to 11 digits in length, depending on the number of products a company manufactures. 

3. Verify the GTIN: Once the GTIN is created, it must be verified to ensure that it is not a duplicate. This can be done using the GS1 Company Database or through a GTIN-validated barcode scanner.

## Conclusion

GTINs are an essential element of the GS1 CBV and are used to accurately identify products throughout the supply chain. By assigning a unique GTIN to each product, manufacturers can ensure that their products are tracked and managed more effectively, improving supply chain efficiency and enabling more precise product traceability. Companies who are considering implementing GS1 standards and adopting the CBV are encouraged to work with their local GS1 member organizations to ensure they comply with regulations and standards set in their particular region.
