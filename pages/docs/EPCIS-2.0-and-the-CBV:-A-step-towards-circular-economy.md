# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV: A step towards circular economy

In recent years, the world has become increasingly aware of the importance of sustainability and circular economy. As a result, industries and governments are stepping up their efforts towards achieving these goals. One of the ways they are doing this is through implementing EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, which are critical tools for achieving circularity.

## Understanding EPCIS

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services. It is a widely-used standard that enables businesses to share information about products as they move through the supply chain. This information can include data on product origin, movement, and destination. One of the benefits of EPCIS is that it enables end-to-end supply chain traceability, which is essential for achieving circularity. By understanding where products come from, how they are used, and where they end up, businesses can identify opportunities for reusing materials, reducing waste, and optimizing resource use.

## The Role of EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is an updated version of EPCIS, which includes several key improvements. One of the most significant changes is the addition of support for blockchains. This is important for achieving circularity because it enables secure, transparent tracking of products and materials across multiple supply chain partners. By leveraging blockchain technology, each participant in the supply chain can be assured of the authenticity and accuracy of the information they receive. This improves trust and creates a more transparent and collaborative ecosystem.

Another key improvement in EPCIS 2.0 is support for event streaming. This means that supply chain partners can access real-time data about product movements and associated events. The availability of this data in real-time enables more efficient decision-making, better collaboration, and improved risk management. This is particularly important when considering circularity, where speed and efficiency are critical to reducing waste and optimizing resource use.

## Introduction to the CBV

The Circular Business Model Validation (CBV) is another critical tool for achieving circularity. It is a framework that is designed to help businesses develop circular business models. The CBV guides organizations through a series of steps, including mapping their value chain, assessing their current business model, identifying circular opportunities, and developing and testing new circular business models. The CBV helps organizations identify and understand opportunities to use and reuse products and materials, reducing the need for virgin resources and minimizing waste.

## How EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV Work Together

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are complementary tools that work together to enable circularity. By leveraging EPCIS 2.0, businesses can track product movement and associated events across the supply chain, identifying opportunities for reuse and resource optimization. This information can then be used to guide the development and testing of new circular business models using the CBV framework. By identifying circular opportunities and testing new circular business models, organizations can work towards achieving circularity and sustainability goals.

## Benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

Implementing EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can provide significant benefits for businesses and the environment. Some of these benefits include:

- Improved traceability: EPCIS 2.0 enables end-to-end supply chain traceability, allowing businesses to identify opportunities for reuse and resource optimization. The CBV helps businesses identify and develop circular business models that leverage this traceability.

- Increased collaboration: EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV enable better collaboration across the supply chain, allowing each participant to share information and work towards common goals. This collaboration is essential for achieving circularity and sustainability goals.

- Reduced waste: By identifying opportunities for reuse and resource optimization, businesses can significantly reduce waste in their operations. This not only reduces environmental impacts but also provides cost savings.

- Improved efficiency: Implementing EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can lead to better decision-making, improved risk management, and more efficient resource use. These efficiencies can help businesses save time and money while reducing their environmental footprint.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are critical tools for achieving circularity and sustainability. By enabling end-to-end supply chain traceability, supporting real-time event streaming, and guiding the development of circular business models, these tools provide businesses with the information and framework they need to reduce waste and optimize resource use. The benefits of implementing EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are significant and include improved collaboration, reduced waste, and improved efficiency. As the world increasingly prioritizes sustainability and circularity, implementing these tools is becoming essential for businesses and governments alike.
