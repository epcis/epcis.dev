# The Power of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV: Explained

## Introduction

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is an Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard that defines a set of rules for sharing and using electronic supply chain data. It is used for tracking inventory, assets, and events throughout the supply chain. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 has been adopted widely by industries such as retail, healthcare, and automotive.

CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a set of standardized terms and definitions that describe the data being exchanged through EPCIS. It ensures that all parties involved in the supply chain have a common understanding of the information being exchanged.

In this blog, we will explore the power of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV.

## Why is GS1 EPCIS 2.0 important?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is important because it provides a common language for sharing supply chain information. This allows companies to exchange information with their trading partners seamlessly. With EPCIS, companies can track products from the point of manufacture to the point of sale, ensuring visibility throughout the supply chain.

EPCIS helps companies reduce costs and improve efficiency. It provides real-time data on inventory levels, so companies can optimize their supply chain operations. EPCIS also helps companies identify bottlenecks in the supply chain, allowing them to make data-driven decisions to improve the process.

With EPCIS, companies can achieve end-to-end traceability. This is important for industries such as healthcare, where traceability is crucial for patient safety. EPCIS ensures that products are tracked from the point of manufacture, to the point of distribution, to the point of care.

## What is CBV?

As mentioned earlier, CBV is a set of standardized terms and definitions that describe the data being exchanged through EPCIS. It ensures that all parties involved in the supply chain have a common understanding of the information being exchanged.

CBV provides a standard vocabulary for product information, location information, and event information. This allows companies to exchange information seamlessly with their trading partners, regardless of the industry or sector.

The CBV vocabulary is divided into three categories:

1. Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) - This includes terms and definitions that are common to all industries, such as "product ID" and "location ID".

2. Business Segment Vocabulary (BSV) - This is industry-specific vocabulary that is defined by each industry sector. For example, the retail sector may have vocabulary for "SKU" and "sales channel", while the healthcare sector may have vocabulary for "patient ID" and "drug name".

3. Local Vocabulary (LV) - This includes terms and definitions that are specific to a company or organization. This allows companies to define their own terminology within the EPCIS framework.

## How does CBV benefit companies?

CBV provides a common language for sharing supply chain information. This allows companies to exchange information seamlessly with their trading partners. With CBV, companies can be confident that their trading partners understand the information being exchanged.

CBV also helps companies reduce costs and improve efficiency. It provides a standardized vocabulary for supply chain information, which eliminates the need for companies to define their own terminology. This saves time and reduces the risk of miscommunication between trading partners.

With CBV, companies can achieve end-to-end traceability. This is crucial for industries such as healthcare, where traceability is crucial for patient safety. CBV ensures that products are tracked from the point of manufacture to the point of care, providing a complete view of the supply chain.

## How can companies adopt GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV?

To adopt GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, companies need to follow some key steps:

1. Identify the data that needs to be tracked and shared within the supply chain.

2. Map the data to the CBV vocabulary.

3. Adopt EPCIS to track and share the data.

4. Integrate EPCIS into existing supply chain systems.

5. Train employees on using EPCIS and CBV.

## Conclusion

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are powerful tools for tracking and sharing supply chain information. EPCIS provides a common language for sharing information, allowing companies to exchange data with their trading partners seamlessly. CBV ensures that all parties have a common understanding of the information being exchanged, reducing the risk of miscommunication and errors.

Adopting GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help companies reduce costs, improve efficiency, and achieve end-to-end traceability. Industries such as retail, healthcare, and automotive have already adopted EPCIS, and other industries are following suit.

To adopt GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, companies need to identify the data that needs to be tracked and shared, map the data to the CBV vocabulary, adopt EPCIS, integrate it into existing systems, and train employees on using EPCIS and CBV.

By following these steps, companies can take advantage of the power of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, and achieve greater visibility, efficiency, and safety throughout their supply chains.
