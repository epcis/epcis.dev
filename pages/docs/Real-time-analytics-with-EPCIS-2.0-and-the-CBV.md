# Real-time analytics with EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

As businesses become increasingly global and interconnected, the need for real-time information has become critical. Supply chains that once operated within regional or national borders now span continents and time zones. The complexity of these supply chains has made it challenging to collect, analyze, and interpret data in a timely and meaningful way.

However, the introduction of the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 standard and the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) has revolutionized the way businesses collect, manage, and use supply chain data. In this post, we will explore how EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV enable real-time analytics and why this is essential for businesses seeking to transform their operations.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is a standard that provides a framework for capturing and sharing supply chain events in real-time. It was developed by GS1, a not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for a variety of industries, including retail, healthcare, and logistics.

EPCIS 2.0 enables businesses to track the movement of goods and assets as they move through the supply chain, from the point of origin to the point of consumption. By capturing data at each step of the journey, businesses can gain real-time visibility into their supply chain operations, enabling them to make informed decisions and respond quickly to changes in demand or supply.

EPCIS 2.0 does this by providing a standardized format for data exchange, enabling information to be shared across multiple systems and partners, regardless of their location or technology platform. This means that businesses can collaborate and share data with suppliers, customers, and logistics providers, regardless of their IT systems.

## What is the CBV?

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of standardized terms that describe the events and objects in a supply chain. It provides a common language that businesses can use to communicate with each other, regardless of their language or cultural differences.

By using a standardized vocabulary, the CBV enables businesses to eliminate ambiguity, reduce errors, and improve data accuracy. This is essential for businesses seeking to gain real-time visibility into their supply chain operations, as it ensures that data can be easily understood and shared across the organization and beyond.

The CBV covers a wide range of supply chain events and objects, including product movements, product information, and location data. It also includes terms for financial transactions, such as purchase orders and invoices, enabling businesses to track the flow of goods and money throughout the supply chain.

## Real-time analytics with EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

The combination of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is a powerful tool for businesses seeking to gain real-time visibility into their supply chain operations. By capturing and sharing data in a standardized format, businesses can analyze the data in real-time, identifying trends, predicting demand, and responding quickly to changes in the market.

Real-time analytics enable businesses to make informed decisions based on current conditions, not historical trends. This is essential in a world where consumer demand can change rapidly, and businesses must be agile enough to respond quickly.

Real-time analytics also enable businesses to optimize their supply chain operations, reducing costs, and improving efficiency. By analyzing data from across the supply chain, businesses can identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and take corrective action to improve overall performance.

Furthermore, real-time analytics enable businesses to gain a competitive advantage, by identifying trends and opportunities before the competition. By leveraging the data generated by EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, businesses can develop new products, services, and business models that meet the needs of their customers.

## The benefits of real-time analytics

Real-time analytics provides a wide range of benefits to businesses seeking to transform their operations. These benefits include:
