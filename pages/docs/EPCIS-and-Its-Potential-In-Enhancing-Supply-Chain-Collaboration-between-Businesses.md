# EPCIS and Its Potential In Enhancing Supply Chain Collaboration between Businesses

In todayâ€™s fast-paced and highly interconnected business world, it has become increasingly important for companies to have a clear understanding of their supply chain operations. The ability to track products, shipments, and inventory in real-time has become a competitive necessity. However, the challenge lies in ensuring that all parties involved in the supply chain are able to access and share this information seamlessly.

Enter EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services). This open standard was designed to help businesses track products as they move through the supply chain by providing a standardized framework for exchanging information. In this article, we explore what EPCIS is, how it works, and its potential to enhance supply chain collaboration between businesses.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is an open standard created by GS1, a global organization that develops and promotes standards for use in supply chains. EPCIS provides a standardized way to capture and share information about the movement of physical items and digital assets, such as inventory, shipments, and products, among supply chain partners.

EPCIS is built on a set of standardized data structures and vocabulary that enable companies to track the lifecycle of products and shipments, from creation to consumption. This information can include data such as the date and time of each event, the location of the event, and the parties involved in the event.

## How does EPCIS work?

EPCIS is based on the concept of event-based tracking. At each point along the supply chain, events are captured and recorded in a standardized format using unique identifiers, such as Global Trade Identification Numbers (GTINs), Serial Shipping Container Codes (SSCCs), and Electronic Product Codes (EPCs). These unique identifiers allow the movement of products and inventory to be tracked and traced across the supply chain.

When an event occurs, such as a product being shipped from a warehouse to a retailer, the event is recorded in a standardized format using the EPCIS data structure. This data is then shared with all parties involved in the supply chain in a secure and standardized way.

## The potential of EPCIS for enhancing supply chain collaboration

EPCIS has the potential to transform supply chain collaboration between businesses in a number of ways:

### Improved visibility

One of the primary benefits of EPCIS is that it provides enhanced visibility into the movement of products and inventory across the supply chain. By providing a standardized way to capture and share information about events, EPCIS enables all parties involved in the supply chain to have a clearer understanding of what is happening at each step. This can help to prevent stockouts, reduce waste, and improve customer satisfaction.

### Increased efficiency

EPCIS can also help to increase efficiency in the supply chain by reducing the amount of time and resources required to track products and inventory. By providing a standardized way to capture and share information about events, EPCIS eliminates the need for companies to develop their own tracking systems, saving time and money.

### Improved collaboration

EPCIS can also improve collaboration between businesses by providing a shared platform for exchanging information. By using a standardized format for capturing and sharing information, EPCIS enables all parties involved in the supply chain to communicate more effectively, reducing misunderstandings and mistakes.

### Enhanced traceability

Traceability is a key requirement in many industries, particularly those where safety and security are critical. EPCIS provides enhanced traceability by providing a standardized way to capture and share information about the movement of products and inventory. This can help to prevent counterfeit products from entering the supply chain, reduce the risk of product recalls, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Improved data analytics

The data captured and shared through EPCIS can be used to create sophisticated data analytics tools. By providing a standardized way to capture and share information about events, EPCIS enables companies to analyze data across their supply chain, identifying trends and patterns that can help to improve operations and reduce costs.

## Conclusion

EPCIS is a powerful tool for enhancing supply chain collaboration between businesses. By providing a standardized way to capture and share information about the movement of products and inventory, EPCIS can help to improve visibility, increase efficiency, and enhance collaboration between all parties involved in the supply chain.

As supply chains become increasingly complex and interconnected, it is essential for businesses to have the tools they need to manage those relationships effectively. EPCIS is a game-changing technology that has the potential to transform the way businesses collaborate and share information across the supply chain. As more companies adopt EPCIS and other similar technologies, we can expect to see significant improvements in supply chain management, efficiency, and profitability.
