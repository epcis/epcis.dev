# How GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Facilitate Global Trade

Global trade has become increasingly complex over the years with numerous regulations, standards, and processes that need to be followed. However, with the advent of emerging technologies like blockchain, smart contracts, and IoT sensors, there is a lot of potential to streamline global trade processes and make them more efficient. That’s where GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV come in – two complementary technologies that can enable end-to-end visibility and traceability of products across supply chains.

## Introduction to GS1 EPCIS 2.0

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard was developed by the global standards organization GS1 to enable real-time visibility and traceability of products across supply chains. EPCIS enables organizations to share information about product movements – including location, time, status and condition – in a standardized way.

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the standard, which was released in 2018. It has many new features, including a more flexible data model and improved support for distributed data sharing and event processing. This makes it an ideal technology for use cases such as global trade, where there are multiple parties involved in the movement of products across borders.

## Introduction to CBV

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a new standard developed by GS1 to enable efficient use of EPCIS data. It provides a set of standardized terms and definitions for use in EPCIS data, ensuring that everyone involved in the supply chain has a common understanding of the data being exchanged.

CBV enables more efficient processing of EPCIS data, enabling better automation and decision-making. It also ensures consistency and accuracy of data across supply chain partners, reducing errors and disputes.

## Benefits of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Global Trade

The combination of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV has many benefits for global trade, including:

### Improved visibility and traceability

With EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, all parties involved in global trade can have real-time visibility and traceability of products across supply chains. This enables faster responses to potential issues, such as delays or product quality concerns, and helps to reduce the risk of fraud or counterfeiting.

### Improved automation and decision-making 

CBV makes it easier to process and analyze large amounts of EPCIS data, enabling more efficient automation and decision-making. This can help reduce errors and delays, and ultimately lead to a more efficient global trade system.

### Increased collaboration and trust 

The standardized data model provided by CBV ensures that all parties involved in global trade have a common understanding of the data being exchanged. This can increase collaboration and trust between supply chain partners, reducing the risk of disputes or disagreements.

### Enhanced regulatory compliance 

Global trade is subject to many regulations and standards, and compliance can be a challenge. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide a standardized way to capture and share data that can help organizations comply with these regulations more efficiently.

## Use Cases for GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in Global Trade

There are many potential use cases for GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in global trade, including:

### Food safety and traceability

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can enable end-to-end traceability of food products across supply chains. This can help reduce the impact of foodborne illnesses and improve food safety.

### Pharmaceutical traceability

The pharmaceutical industry is subject to strict regulations around product traceability. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help ensure compliance with these regulations, as well as enabling faster response times to potential product quality issues.

### Product authenticity verification 

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help prevent counterfeit products from entering global supply chains. By enabling real-time traceability and verification, supply chain partners can ensure that the products being traded are authentic and meet the required quality standards.

## Challenges and Limitations

While GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV have many potential benefits for global trade, there are also some challenges and limitations to consider. These include:

### Cost and complexity 

Implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can be complex and expensive, requiring significant investment in technology and personnel. This can be a barrier to adoption, particularly for smaller organizations.

### Adoption and interoperability 

For EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to be effective, they need to be adopted by a critical mass of supply chain partners. Interoperability among systems can be a challenge, particularly where different technologies and standards are being used.

### Privacy and security 

Real-time visibility of products across supply chains can increase the risk of privacy and security breaches. It is important to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect confidential and sensitive information.

## Conclusion

Global trade is a complex and challenging environment, but with emerging technologies like GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, there is potential to make it more efficient and effective. By enabling end-to-end visibility and traceability of products across supply chains, organizations can respond more quickly to potential issues, reduce the risk of fraud and counterfeiting, and ensure compliance with regulations and standards.

While there are challenges and limitations to consider, the benefits of adopting EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are clear. As more organizations look to digitize their supply chains and improve their global trade processes, these technologies are likely to become increasingly important.
