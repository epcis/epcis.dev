# **How EPCIS Provides End-to-End Visibility in Supply Chain Management**

In today's modern era, the supply chain management system is extremely complex. The goods and services have to go through a range of suppliers, manufacturers, and buyers before they reach the intended end-users. This complexity can lead to inefficiencies, delays, errors, and fraud in the supply chain. Therefore, it becomes essential to keep track of the flow of products and information across the entire supply chain. This is where EPCIS comes in.

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a globally recognized standard for sharing and exchanging information across the entire supply chain. It allows businesses to track and trace the movement of goods, and share this information with various supply chain partners, including suppliers, customers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders.

EPCIS leverages IoT technology, RFID, barcodes, and QR codes to facilitate real-time tracking and monitoring of every stage in the supply chain. This is important for businesses that want to improve their supply chain visibility and want to ensure that their products are delivered on time, with minimum delays, and in the best condition possible.

In this blog post, we will explore how EPCIS provides end-to-end visibility in supply chain management and why businesses must adopt this technology to stay ahead in the competitive market.

## **EPCIS Components**

Before diving into the details, let's first understand the three essential components of EPCIS:

### **Event Capturing System (ECS)**
The ECS is responsible for capturing and generating events that occur at various stages of the supply chain. For example, an ECS might capture an event when products are moved from a warehouse to another location, when they are loaded onto a truck, or when they arrive at a destination port.

The events captured by ECS are stored in a database, along with a unique Electronic Product Code (EPC) that relates to a specific product or shipment. This allows businesses to track the movement of goods across the supply chain and identify the exact location of a product at any given time.

### **Event Repository (ER)**
The ER is responsible for storing event data generated by ECS. It acts as a central repository for all event data, allowing businesses to access and share the information across different supply chain partners.

The ER also stores metadata related to events, such as the time and location of the event, the device used to capture the event, and other relevant information.

### **Query Interface (QI)**
The QI is responsible for providing an interface that allows businesses to access and query the data stored in the ER. This interface can be used to generate reports, analyze data, and make informed decisions about supply chain management.

## **EPCIS and End-to-End Visibility**

With the help of EPCIS, businesses can achieve end-to-end visibility in supply chain management. It allows them to track the flow of products and information across the entire supply chain, from raw material suppliers to the final end-users.

Here’s How:

### **Track and Trace Products**
The EPCIS system provides the ability to track and trace products as they move through the supply chain. Each product is assigned a unique identification number, and businesses can track its location, movements, and condition at any given time.

This level of visibility is critical in managing product recalls, managing inventory levels, and ensuring that products are delivered on time with minimal delays.

### **Monitor and Manage Inventory**
EPCIS provides real-time visibility into inventory levels, allowing businesses to monitor and manage their stock levels at different stages of the supply chain. This helps in better planning and forecasting, and reduces the risk of stockouts and overstocking.

It also helps in identifying slow-moving products and enables businesses to take corrective actions such as promotions, discounts or liquidation sales.

### **Improve Product Quality**
With EPCIS, businesses can identify the quality of products at different stages of the supply chain. The system can help in monitoring temperature control during transportation, product handling, and other vital parameters that affect product quality.

Businesses can quickly detect and isolate any issue that may arise in the supply chain and take corrective actions. This helps in maintaining the quality of the products, ensuring better customer satisfaction, and reducing the risk of product recalls.

### **Reduction in Supply Chain Costs**
EPCIS enables businesses to optimize their supply chain by reducing supply chain costs. It allows them to identify inefficiencies in the supply chain, such as long lead times, delays, and wastage, and take corrective action.

With improved inventory management, better forecasting, and reduced wastage, businesses can identify cost-saving opportunities and streamline their operations.

## **Conclusion**
In conclusion, EPCIS provides end-to-end visibility in supply chain management. It enables businesses to track and trace products, monitor and manage inventory, improve product quality, and reduce supply chain costs. Adopting EPCIS technology can help businesses in achieving better supply chain visibility, improved operational efficiency, and better customer satisfaction. EPCIS is no more a luxury but an essential tool that can provide an edge in today’s competitive business environment.
