# Incorporating BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 to Improve Visibility Across the Supply Chain

When it comes to supply chain management, visibility is key. It allows companies to track their products throughout the entire supply chain, from creation to delivery. With improved visibility, companies can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate risks. This is where EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps come in.

In this article, we will discuss how incorporating BizSteps into EPCIS 2.0 can help improve visibility across the supply chain.

## Understanding EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services. It is a standard for sharing supply chain data in a standardized format that can be easily understood by different supply chain partners. EPCIS can capture and store information about the movement of goods, including where they were produced, when they were shipped, and when they were received. This data can then be shared with partners in the supply chain to improve visibility.

EPCIS 2.0 is an updated version of the standard released in 2013. It includes improved support for events, which are actions that happen in the supply chain, such as when a product is scanned at a warehouse or delivered to a customer.

## Understanding BizSteps

BizSteps is a set of standardized terminology that can be used to describe events in the supply chain. It was developed by GS1, a global standards organization for supply chain management. BizSteps includes terminology for common events such as receiving goods, shipping goods, and requesting information.

BizSteps is designed to provide a common language for supply chain partners to use when sharing information about their events. This makes it easier for partners to understand each other's data and process it more efficiently.

## Incorporating BizSteps into EPCIS 2.0

By incorporating BizSteps into EPCIS 2.0, companies can improve the visibility of their supply chain events. By using a standardized terminology, partners can easily understand each other's data and process it more efficiently. This can lead to reduced costs, improved efficiency, and reduced risk.

For example, imagine a company is shipping a product to a customer. They use the BizSteps terminology to describe the event, including the date and time of shipment and the carrier used. This information is then captured in the EPCIS 2.0 format and shared with their partner, who can easily understand the data and use it to improve their own processes.

In addition to improved visibility, incorporating BizSteps into EPCIS 2.0 can also improve data quality. By using a standardized terminology, partners can help ensure their data is accurate and complete. This can lead to more efficient processes and fewer errors.

## Benefits of Incorporating BizSteps into EPCIS 2.0

There are many benefits to incorporating BizSteps into EPCIS 2.0. These include:

### Improved Visibility

By using a standardized terminology, partners can easily understand each other's data and process it more efficiently. This can lead to improved visibility of supply chain events, which can help companies improve efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate risks.

### Improved Data Quality

By using a standardized terminology, partners can help ensure their data is accurate and complete. This can lead to more efficient processes and fewer errors.

### Improved Efficiency

By using a standardized terminology and format, partners can process data more efficiently. This can lead to reduced costs and improved overall efficiency.

### Reduced Costs

Improved efficiency can lead to reduced costs throughout the supply chain. By using a standardized terminology and format, partners can process data more efficiently, which can lead to reduced administrative costs and improved overall efficiency.

### Mitigated Risks

Improved visibility can help companies mitigate risks throughout the supply chain. By having a better understanding of supply chain events, companies can identify potential risks and take steps to mitigate them.

## Conclusion

Incorporating BizSteps into EPCIS 2.0 can help improve visibility across the supply chain. By using a standardized terminology and format, partners can easily understand each other's data and process it more efficiently. This can lead to reduced costs, improved efficiency, and reduced risks throughout the supply chain.

If you're interested in improving the visibility of your supply chain events, consider incorporating BizSteps into your EPCIS 2.0 implementation. It could be the key to unlocking new efficiencies and reducing costs throughout your supply chain.
