# EPCIS for Global Trade Compliance

The global trade landscape is constantly evolving and increasing in complexity. With the rise of e-commerce and globalization, businesses are expanding their supply chains across countries and continents. This expansion has created challenges for companies in being able to comply with global trade regulations. In order to address these challenges, Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) has emerged as a valuable tool.

EPCIS is a standard for tracking and sharing supply chain event data, which can be used to ensure compliance with trade regulations across the globe. In this blog post, we will explore the key benefits of using EPCIS for global trade compliance, and how it can help companies navigate the complex regulatory environment.

## What is EPCIS?

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is an open standard developed by GS1, a not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for business communication. EPCIS is designed to provide a standardized way of tracking and sharing supply chain data by allowing the capture and exchange of event data related to the movement of goods and assets through the supply chain.

 EPCIS enables companies to capture and store data about the movement of goods and assets, such as their location, timestamp, temperature, and other environmental conditions. This data can then be used to provide visibility and insights into the supply chain, helping companies optimize operations and improve customer service.

## How EPCIS Helps with Global Trade Compliance

The rise of globalization has led to the emergence of a complex regulatory environment that companies must navigate in order to trade globally. These regulations include trade agreements, customs regulations, health and safety standards, environmental regulations, and more.

EPCIS can help companies comply with these regulations by providing visibility and control over their supply chains. By capturing and sharing data about the movement of goods and assets, companies can ensure that they are complying with regulations related to the origin, contents, and movement of their products.

For example, EPCIS can help companies comply with the European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires companies to provide data protection and privacy for their customers. By capturing and sharing data about the movement of goods and assets, companies can ensure that they are complying with GDPR regulations related to data privacy and protection.

## Benefits of Using EPCIS for Global Trade Compliance

There are several benefits of using EPCIS for global trade compliance, including:

### 1. Increased Visibility and Control

EPCIS provides companies with increased visibility and control over their supply chains by enabling them to capture and share event data related to the movement of goods and assets. This data can be used to identify issues and inefficiencies in the supply chain, and to take corrective action where needed.

By having increased visibility and control over the supply chain, companies can ensure that they are complying with regulations related to the origin, contents, and movement of their products.

### 2. Improved Traceability

EPCIS enables companies to capture and share data related to the movement of goods and assets, which can be used to improve traceability across the supply chain. This can be particularly important in industries such as pharmaceuticals, where traceability is critical for ensuring the safety of products.

By using EPCIS to improve traceability, companies can ensure that their products are being shipped, stored, and handled in compliance with regulations related to health and safety, and that they are not being counterfeited or diverted.

### 3. Reduced Risk of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with global trade regulations can result in significant financial penalties and damage to a company's reputation. EPCIS can help reduce the risk of non-compliance by providing companies with visibility and control over their supply chains, enabling them to identify and address issues before they become non-compliant.

By using EPCIS to reduce the risk of non-compliance, companies can avoid costly and damaging penalties, and protect their reputation and brand.

### 4. Improved Customer Service

EPCIS can also be used to improve customer service by providing customers with increased visibility into the supply chain. By allowing customers to track the movement of their orders, companies can provide them with real-time updates on the status of their delivery, improving the overall customer experience.

## Challenges of Implementing EPCIS

While EPCIS can provide significant benefits for global trade compliance, there are also challenges to implementing it effectively. These challenges can include:

### 1. Data Quality

Capturing and sharing accurate and reliable data is critical for the effectiveness of EPCIS. However, data quality can be difficult to ensure, particularly in complex supply chains with multiple partners.

In order to address this challenge, companies need to establish data governance processes and procedures to ensure that data is captured and shared accurately and reliably across the supply chain.

### 2. Integration with Legacy Systems

Integrating EPCIS with legacy systems can also be a challenge, particularly for companies with older infrastructure. In order to ensure effective integration, companies need to invest in appropriate technology and expertise to support the implementation and maintenance of EPCIS.

### 3. Collaboration with Partners

Collaborating with partners in the supply chain is also critical for the effectiveness of EPCIS. However, achieving collaboration can be difficult, particularly when partners have different systems and processes in place.

In order to overcome this challenge, companies need to establish effective partnerships and collaboration processes that enable them to share data and track movements across the supply chain.

## Conclusion

EPCIS is a valuable tool for global trade compliance, providing companies with increased visibility and control over their supply chains, improved traceability, reduced risk of non-compliance, and improved customer service. While implementing EPCIS requires overcoming challenges related to data quality, integration with legacy systems, and collaboration with partners, the benefits are significant.

Companies that are looking to compete globally and comply with regulatory requirements can benefit significantly from adopting EPCIS as a tool for managing their supply chain. As the global trade landscape continues to evolve, EPCIS will become an increasingly important tool for companies looking to optimize their operations and comply with global trade regulations.
