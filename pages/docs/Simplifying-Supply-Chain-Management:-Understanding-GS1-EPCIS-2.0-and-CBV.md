# Simplifying Supply Chain Management: Understanding GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

Supply chain management plays a key role in ensuring the effective and efficient movement of goods and services across the globe. As supply chains continue to expand and become more complex, it’s critical to establish a standardized and transparent means of tracking and exchanging information. 

That’s where GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV come in. These industry standards enable supply chain participants to capture, share, and utilize valuable data in a consistent and automated way. In this blog post, we’ll provide an introduction and deep dive into these two technologies, including what they are, how they work, and their benefits.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

GS1 EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) 2.0 is a data standard developed by the GS1 organization for tracking products as they move through the supply chain. It enables companies to capture and share event-based data at every stage of the product life cycle in real-time, providing unparalleled visibility and traceability across the supply chain.

At its core, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is designed to enable the exchange of information related to the movement and status of products or assets. It does this by establishing a common language for encoding information into unique identifiers that can be read by all parties in the supply chain. It also enables automated data exchange between disparate systems, reducing the need for manual data entry and minimizing the risk of errors or discrepancies.

## How Does GS1 EPCIS 2.0 Work?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 comprises a set of rules, formats, and communication protocols that enable the capture, transmission, and sharing of XML messages containing standardized data about specific events or transactions. These events might include product movements, inventory levels, changes in ownership, or any other relevant data point.

The data itself is encoded using a standardized set of identifiers, including the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), which provides a unique identification number for each product. Additional identifiers, such as the Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) and Global Location Number (GLN), are used to track individual shipments, units, and warehouses.

Once the data is captured or created, it’s transmitted through a standardized message format, known as the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) message. This message contains a set of standard business vocabularies that enable the data to be interpreted and understood by all parties in the supply chain.

## What are the Benefits of GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

The benefits of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 are numerous and far-reaching. By enabling automated and standardized data exchange across the supply chain, it provides a number of key advantages that help companies optimize their operations and maintain better control over their products.

Some of these benefits include:

- **Improved visibility and traceability:** GS1 EPCIS 2.0 enables companies to track their products and assets at every stage of the supply chain. This provides valuable visibility into where products are, what condition they’re in, and even where they’ve been. It also enables fast and accurate tracing of products in the event of recalls, allergen alerts, or other safety concerns.
- **Increased efficiency and productivity:** By automating data exchange and eliminating the need for manual data entry, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies while also increasing efficiency and productivity. With every party in the supply chain using the same standardized vocabulary and data format, processes can be streamlined and communication can be enhanced.
- **Enhanced collaboration and information sharing:** GS1 EPCIS 2.0 provides a common language and format for exchanging data across the supply chain. This enables greater collaboration and information sharing between trading partners, leading to better decision-making and faster responsiveness to changing market conditions.
- **Compliance with regulatory requirements:** GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is recognized as a compliant data standard by a number of regulatory bodies around the world. By adopting this standard, companies can ensure that they’re meeting all relevant regulatory requirements related to product tracking, safety, and quality.

## What is CBV?

While GS1 EPCIS 2.0 provides valuable data tracking and exchange capabilities, it’s just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to supply chain management. That’s where CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) comes in.

CBV is a set of standardized vocabularies that enables companies to communicate with each other in a consistent and effective manner. It specifies the content and structure of business documents, such as purchase orders, invoices, and shipping notices, ensuring that all parties can understand and interpret the information being exchanged.

In essence, CBV builds a bridge between business processes and data exchange. By defining a common vocabulary and format for business documents, it enables trading partners to communicate more effectively while reducing the risk of errors or misinterpretation.

## How Does CBV Work?

CBV consists of a set of predefined business vocabularies that are used to encode and interpret data in specific business documents. For example, the “Product” vocabulary defines the data elements needed to describe a product, including its name, SKU number, and price. Similarly, the “Party” vocabulary defines the data elements needed to identify a business entity, such as its name, address, and contact information.

CBV makes use of established industry standards, such as XML and Open Data Protocol (OData), to enable the exchange of information between disparate systems. By adopting these standards, CBV ensures that data can be exchanged in a consistent and standardized format, regardless of the underlying systems or platforms being used.

## What are the Benefits of CBV?

CBV provides a number of valuable benefits to companies involved in supply chain management. These include:

- **Improved communication and collaboration:** By establishing a common language and format for business documents, CBV enables trading partners to communicate more effectively and collaborate more closely. This leads to faster decision-making, better responsiveness to changing market conditions, and improved customer service.
- **Reduced data entry errors:** By standardizing the data elements used in business documents, CBV reduces the risk of errors and discrepancies that can arise when data is manually entered or interpreted. This improves data accuracy and reduces the need for manual intervention or correction.
- **Lower costs and faster implementation:** By providing a set of predefined vocabularies and data elements, CBV reduces the need for custom development and simplifies the implementation of supply chain management systems. This can lead to faster implementation times, lower costs, and quicker ROI.
- **Greater compliance with regulatory requirements:** By adopting CBV, companies can ensure that they’re adhering to relevant regulatory guidelines and requirements related to data exchange and supply chain management.

## Conclusion

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are two powerful tools that enable companies to improve their supply chain management processes and optimize their operations. By establishing a common language and format for data exchange, these standards reduce the risk of errors and discrepancies, enhance collaboration and communication, and provide unprecedented visibility and traceability across the supply chain.

As supply chains continue to expand and become more complex, it’s critical to establish standardized and transparent means of tracking and exchanging information. By adopting GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, companies can ensure that they’re not only meeting regulatory requirements but also optimizing their operations and staying competitive in a rapidly evolving marketplace.
