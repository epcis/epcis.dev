# Streamlining Serialization with EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

Serialization is a critical process in the supply chain, ensuring the traceability and authenticity of products. It involves assigning a unique identifier to each product, which is then tracked and recorded at each stage of the supply chain. Serialization enables effective product authentication, efficient recall in case of issues, and regulatory compliance.

However, serialization can be a complex process, especially in large-scale supply chains. There are many different ways that products can be identified, and keeping track of all of them can be daunting. This is where EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV come in.

## EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a standard developed by the GS1, a not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for business communication. EPCIS aims to enable real-time visibility and sharing of supply chain information, enabling better collaboration and decision-making.

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the standard, released in 2015. It builds on the previous version of the standard, adding new features such as support for blockchain and enhanced event modeling.

The key benefits of using EPCIS for serialization include:

- Standardization: EPCIS provides a standardized framework for tracking and sharing supply chain information. This means that different organizations can use the same language and structures, reducing confusion and errors.
- Real-time tracking: EPCIS enables real-time tracking of products, providing up-to-date information on their location and status.
- Scalability: EPCIS is designed to work in large-scale supply chains, supporting millions of transactions per day.

Overall, EPCIS is a powerful tool for streamlining serialization and improving supply chain visibility.

## CBV

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a standardized vocabulary for describing supply chain events. It was developed by the GS1 to complement EPCIS and enable better event modeling.

The CBV provides a standardized framework for describing supply chain events, including things like shipments, shipments information, item information, location information etc. Each event is described using a set of standardized attributes, such as event time, event type, and location. This standardized approach makes it easy for different systems to communicate and exchange information.

Using the CBV for serialization can be highly beneficial, since it:

- Provides a common language for describing serialization events, reducing errors and confusion.
- Enables more accurate and detailed serialization data, improving product traceability and recall efficiency.
- Facilitates regulatory compliance by providing a standardized framework for serialization data.

In summary, using the CBV in conjunction with EPCIS can help to streamline serialization and improve supply chain visibility.

## Combining EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Serialization

Using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV together can provide a powerful solution for serialization in the supply chain. By using both standards, organizations can ensure that they are using a common language and standardized structures, reducing errors and improving communication between stakeholders.

For example, an organization could use EPCIS 2.0 to track the movement of products through the supply chain, recording each event in a standardized format using the CBV. This would allow the organization to quickly trace the movement of products in case of issues, as well as provide accurate and detailed serialization data for regulatory purposes.

Additionally, using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV together enables better collaboration and decision-making between supply chain stakeholders. By sharing real-time information in a standardized format, organizations can quickly identify issues and take corrective action, improving supply chain efficiency and reducing costs.

## Conclusion

Serialization is a critical process in the supply chain, enabling product traceability, authentication, and compliance. However, it can also be a complex process, especially in large-scale supply chains.

Fortunately, by using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, organizations can streamline the serialization process and improve supply chain visibility. These standards provide a common language and standardized structures for describing supply chain events, enabling better communication, collaboration, and decision-making.

Overall, the use of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV for serialization represents a key transformation in the way that supply chains operate, enabling more efficient, effective, and secure supply chain operations.
