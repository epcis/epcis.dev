# The Nuts and Bolts of CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0: A Practical Guide

If you are working with the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard, you may have come across the term CBV or Core Business Vocabulary. In this practical guide, we will explore the nuts and bolts of CBV and how it works within the EPCIS 2.0 ecosystem.

## Understanding the Basics of EPCIS 2.0

Before diving into CBV, it’s important to have a basic understanding of what EPCIS 2.0 is and how it works. EPCIS 2.0, or Electronic Product Code Information Services, is a standard for sharing supply chain event data between trading partners. It enables the exchange of information about the movement and status of physical goods and assets across the supply chain.

EPCIS 2.0 is built on a modular architecture that allows for customization and flexibility in implementation. It includes a set of standard interfaces, data structures, and information models that support data exchange between various supply chain systems.

## What is Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)?

CBV is a set of standardized terms and definitions that enable consistent and accurate communication and interoperability between different supply chain systems. It provides a common language for exchanging information about supply chain events and enables trading partners to communicate more efficiently.

CBV includes standard definitions for attributes such as product identifier, quantity, location, and time. It also standardizes the vocabulary around key supply chain events, including shipment, receipt, and transfer.

CBV is a critical component of the EPCIS 2.0 standard, as it enables trading partners to share data seamlessly across different systems, regardless of their origin or destination.

## How Does CBV Work in EPCIS 2.0?

CBV is implemented as a set of data elements or attributes in EPCIS 2.0 events. Each event in EPCIS 2.0 includes a set of predefined CBV attributes that standardize the information being shared.

For example, a shipment event in EPCIS 2.0 includes CBV attributes for the shipment identifier, shipper, consignee, and shipment date. These standardized attributes enable trading partners to easily understand and process the information being shared.

CBV also includes standard event types, such as “Shipment,” “Receipt,” and “Inventory,” each with a specific set of attributes. When a trading partner receives an EPCIS 2.0 event, they can easily identify the type of event and its associated CBV attributes.

## Benefits of Using CBV in EPCIS 2.0

Using CBV in EPCIS 2.0 offers several key benefits for supply chain stakeholders:

### Increased Interoperability

CBV provides a common language for exchanging information, enabling trading partners to communicate more efficiently and accurately. By standardizing the vocabulary and definitions used in EPCIS 2.0 events, CBV enables interoperability across different supply chain systems.

### Improved Data Quality

By using predefined CBV attributes, data quality is improved by ensuring that consistent and accurate information is being shared between trading partners. This reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies that can occur when using non-standardized data.

### Simplified Integration

CBV simplifies the integration of different supply chain systems by standardizing the vocabulary and definitions used in EPCIS 2.0 events. This reduces the complexity and cost of integrating disparate systems, enabling faster and more efficient data exchange.

### Enhanced Visibility and Traceability

By standardizing the information shared in EPCIS 2.0 events, CBV enables enhanced visibility and traceability across the supply chain. This supports improved decision-making and enables stakeholders to quickly identify and respond to supply chain issues.

## Implementing CBV in EPCIS 2.0

Implementing CBV in EPCIS 2.0 can be straightforward and relatively easy, especially if you are working with a certified EPCIS 2.0 provider.

To implement CBV, you should start by familiarizing yourself with the standard CBV attributes and event types included in EPCIS 2.0. You can find detailed information about these in the EPCIS 2.0 specification.

Next, you should map your internal data structures to the CBV attributes and event types. This involves identifying which attributes in your internal systems correspond to the CBV attributes in EPCIS 2.0.

Finally, you should test your implementation to ensure that it is working correctly and that you are exchanging data with your trading partners successfully.

## Conclusion

CBV is an essential component of the EPCIS 2.0 standard, enabling consistent and accurate communication between supply chain systems. By standardizing the vocabulary and definitions used in EPCIS 2.0 events, CBV provides increased interoperability, improved data quality, simplified integration, and enhanced visibility and traceability.

Implementing CBV in EPCIS 2.0 can be straightforward and easy, provided that you have a good understanding of the standard attributes and event types, and have mapped your internal data structures accordingly.

Overall, CBV is an important tool for unlocking the full potential of EPCIS 2.0 in today’s complex supply chain environment.
