# Achieving Greater Supply Chain Efficiency with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

In today's digitally-driven world, supply chain management has become crucial for businesses to compete in the global marketplace. Having an efficient supply chain can give companies a competitive edge by reducing costs, improving customer service, increasing agility and flexibility, and enhancing sustainability. The ability to track, trace and share information across supply chain partners and systems is essential, and this is where GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV come in.

## GS1 EPCIS 2.0: Introduction and Overview 

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a global standard for the transfer of standardized data between supply chain partners. It enables the capture, sharing, and analysis of diverse real-time data from multiple sources in a consistent and automated manner. This standardized data exchange supports end-to-end supply chain visibility, product traceability, and provides a foundation for advanced analytics and optimization.

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, and it defines how data is exchanged and stored in the supply chain. EPCIS includes a set of standard events such as Goods Receipt, Shipping, and Delivery, as well as data attributes such as product description, batch or lot numbers, and expiration dates.

## CBV: Introduction and Overview 

CBV stands for Core Business Vocabulary, and it is a set of common data elements that simplifies the exchange of information across different supply chain partners, systems, and technologies. CBV is based on GS1 standards and enables a common understanding of data elements and their meaning, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

CBV includes a set of core data elements such as product identification, location, measurement/dimension, and date/time. These elements provide a consistent and standardized way to describe supply chain events, transactions, and inventory levels.

CBV also includes structured vocabularies that standardize product, location, and unit-of-measure descriptions. This standardization helps to improve data integrity, reduce errors, and enable greater automation and optimization of supply chain processes.

## GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV: Benefits and Applications

The combination of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provides several benefits and applications for organizations looking to optimize their supply chain operations.

### Supply Chain Visibility and Traceability

EPCIS 2.0 enables real-time tracking and tracing of products and assets across the supply chain, from raw materials to finished goods. By capturing and exchanging key data elements such as supplier information, logistics information, and inventory levels in real-time, companies can quickly respond to supply chain disruptions, minimize product recalls, and improve customer satisfaction.

CBV provides a common language for describing supply chain events and transactions, enabling greater visibility and traceability across different systems and partners. This standardization improves data accuracy and consistency, reduces errors and enables automation of supply chain processes, such as stock replenishment and order fulfillment.

### Improved Data Accuracy and Consistency

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can improve data accuracy and consistency by enabling a standardized and automated way of capturing, sharing and analyzing data. This reduces manual data entry errors, eliminates discrepancies in data interpretation, and improves supply chain partner communication.

### Enhanced Analytics and Optimization

Using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV enables the capture and exchange of real-time data, which can be used to conduct advanced analytics and optimization. By leveraging this data, companies can identify inefficiencies in the supply chain, optimize inventory levels, and reduce costs. This increased visibility and data-driven decision-making can also enable greater agility, responsiveness, and sustainability across the entire supply chain.

## Implementation Considerations

Implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV requires careful planning and consideration, including:

### Data Management Platform 

A data management platform is required to collect, process, and store data captured from EPCIS 2.0 and CBV events. The data management platform should be able to support a wide range of data sources and standards, have built-in data validation and exception management capabilities, and provide easy-to-use analytics and visualization tools.

### Partner Integration 

Partner integration is essential for EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to be effective. Collaborating with supply chain partners to define data exchange requirements and establish standard interfaces is critical for successful integration. This includes defining data attributes, codes, and standards such as GTIN, GLN, and GPC.

### Common Operating Procedures

Standardizing operating procedures is necessary to ensure consistent implementation and effective use of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. This includes defining data capture and validation rules, establishing workflows and escalation rules, and setting up exception management procedures.

### Training and Education 

Training and education are critical for successful implementation and adoption of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. This includes educating stakeholders on the benefits of using these standards, training supply chain partners on data capture and validation procedures, and providing ongoing education and support.

## Conclusion

In today's data-driven supply chain environment, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help companies achieve greater efficiency, visibility, and agility. These standards enable data sharing and exchange across supply chain partners, enabling real-time tracking and tracing of products and assets, improving data accuracy and consistency, and enabling greater analytics and optimization.

Successfully implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV requires careful planning and consideration, including the use of a data management platform, partner integration, standard operating procedures, and ongoing training and education. By leveraging these standards, organizations can gain a competitive edge and optimize their supply chain operations.
