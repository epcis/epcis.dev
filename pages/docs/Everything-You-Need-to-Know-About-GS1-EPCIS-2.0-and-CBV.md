# Everything You Need to Know About GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

If you've ever worked with supply chain management, inventory control, or data analysis, chances are, you've heard of or have had experience working with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. These systems have become critical components of effective supply chain management.

In this blog post, we will be diving into the world of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. We'll cover what they are, their history, their technical details, and the critical benefits and challenges of using them in the supply chain industry.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standard for Electronic Product Code Information Services. It enables supply chain visibility by providing accurate, real-time, and in-depth tracking of goods as they move through the supply chain. The system facilitates communication of event data between trading partners, which helps to optimize supply chain operations.

In simpler terms, EPCIS 2.0 is a standardized way of tracking products as they move through the supply chain â€“ from manufacturing to retail, and everything in between. It provides a shared language for businesses and their partners to communicate event data and product information in a standard, agreed-upon way.

The benefits of using EPCIS 2.0 are numerous. With it, businesses can gain improved visibility into their supply chain, enabling them to better manage inventory, reduce waste, and save money. It also enables them to effectively identify and address supply chain issues, hindrances, and problems in real-time, leading to an overall increase in efficiency and productivity.

## What is CBV?

CBV, or Core Business Vocabulary, is an extension of EPCIS 2.0 that offers a standardized vocabulary for businesses to use when exchanging supply chain data. The vocabulary provides a common language for businesses and their partners, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and agreeing on standard terms.

Part of what makes supply chain management difficult is navigating terminology and language differences between different businesses and partners. This language gap can cause communication issues, leading to confusion and mistakes. CBV helps to address these issues by providing a common language that all businesses can use.

In short, CBV improves supply chain communication by offering a standardized vocabulary and enabling all participants to achieve a shared understanding of events and product interactions.

## History of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 & CBV

The history of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is closely tied to the development of GS1 standards, which originated in Europe in the 1970s. In the mid-1990s, GS1 expanded to other parts of the world, including the United States.

EPCIS was first introduced in 2007 and has undergone numerous revisions and improvements since then. The current version, EPCIS 2.0, was ratified in 2019 and introduced a range of new features and functionality.

CBV, meanwhile, was developed to complement EPCIS 2.0 and provide a standardized vocabulary that businesses could use to exchange information quickly and easily.

## Technical Details of EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is built on top of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) standard, which is used to track physical items around a supply chain. EPCIS 2.0 uses several types of data to provide a complete picture of product movements and supply chain interactions.

Event data is the primary type of data used by EPCIS 2.0. Events are defined as any action or state change that affects the supply chain. Examples include the shipment of goods, the receipt of goods, the transfer of ownership, and the payment of bills.

Object data is another type of data used by EPCIS 2.0. Object data includes information about items that are being tracked, such as a product's serial number, batch number, or expiration date.

EPCIS 2.0 also uses several different types of vocabulary, including CBV, to ensure that all participants are using the same language when exchanging event and object data.

Ultimately, EPCIS 2.0's technical details are complex but are designed to provide a complete picture of supply chain interactions in real-time, enabling businesses to optimize their operations and improve efficiency.

## Benefits of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

There are many benefits to implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in your supply chain. These benefits include:

### Improved Supply Chain Visibility

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV enable businesses to gain a clearer view of their supply chain, identifying issues and opportunities in real-time. With improved visibility, businesses can optimize their operations, avoid bottlenecks, and reduce costs.

### Standardized Communication

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide a standardized language for businesses and their partners to communicate. This common vocabulary reduces the chance of communication errors and misunderstandings, ultimately leading to better supply chain performance.

### Increased Efficiency

By enabling businesses to identify issues and opportunities in their supply chain in real-time, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV help to increase overall efficiency. This ultimately leads to increased productivity and cost savings for businesses.

## Challenges of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

While there are many benefits to implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in your supply chain, there are also some challenges to consider. These challenges include:

### Implementation Complexity

Implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can be complex, particularly for businesses that are not familiar with the technical details of these systems. This can require additional staff training and IT support.

### System Compatibility

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV require all participants in the supply chain to be using the same systems and vocabularies. This can be a challenge, particularly when working with partners that are not familiar with these systems.

### Data Quality

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV rely on accurate data to provide a complete picture of supply chain operations. This means that businesses must ensure that their data is accurate and up-to-date, which can be a challenge given the upstream/downstream nature of supply chains.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are integral components of modern supply chain management. They provide businesses with real-time visibility into operations, standardized vocabularies for communication, and increased efficiency.

While implementing these systems can be challenging, the benefits far outweigh the challenges. By improving supply chain visibility and enabling standardized communication, businesses can optimize their operations, reduce costs, and increase efficiency, leading to long-term success in the marketplace.
