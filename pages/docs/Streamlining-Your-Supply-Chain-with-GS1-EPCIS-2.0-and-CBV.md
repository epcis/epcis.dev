# Streamlining Your Supply Chain with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

Managing a supply chain can be a complex and challenging task. With so many moving parts, it's not uncommon for things to go wrong or for inefficiencies to occur. Fortunately, technology can help. One such technology is GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV.

In this blog post, we'll take a deep dive into GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, and explore how they can streamline your supply chain, improve visibility, and reduce inefficiencies.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

Firstly, let's start with the basics. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standard for sharing event data across different supply chain systems. It was developed by GS1, a not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for business communication.

With EPCIS 2.0, different systems can exchange event data in a standardized format, making it easier to understand and analyze data from different sources. This can help to improve visibility into your supply chain and make it easier to spot inefficiencies.

## What are CBVs?

CBV stands for "Core Business Vocabulary." It's a set of standardized language for describing the different events that occur in a supply chain. This includes everything from when goods are shipped, to when they arrive at a warehouse, to when they are received by a customer.

By standardizing the language used to describe these events, it becomes easier for different systems to understand and exchange information. This can help to improve communication between different parties within the supply chain, and reduce the risk of errors or misunderstandings.

## How can GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV streamline your supply chain?

Now that we've covered the basics of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, let's explore how they can streamline your supply chain.

### Improved visibility

One of the key benefits of using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is improved visibility into your supply chain. With standardized event data, you can gain a better understanding of what's happening at each stage of the supply chain.

For example, you can track the movement of goods from the manufacturer to the warehouse to the retailer, and see where any delays or bottlenecks are occurring. This can help you to identify areas where you can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

### Faster, more accurate communication

By standardizing the language used to describe events in your supply chain, it becomes easier for different systems to communicate with each other. This can help to speed up communication and reduce the risk of errors or misunderstandings.

For example, if a shipment of goods is delayed, the manufacturer can easily update the retailer on the new delivery date using standardized event data. This helps to ensure that everyone involved in the supply chain has the most up-to-date information, and can plan accordingly.

### Reduced inefficiencies

By improving visibility and communication within your supply chain, you can identify and reduce inefficiencies. For example, if you notice that a particular shipment is consistently delayed at a particular warehouse, you can investigate the root cause and take steps to address it.

Similarly, if you notice that a particular retailer consistently understocks a certain product, you can work with them to ensure they have sufficient inventory. By addressing these inefficiencies, you can reduce costs and improve the overall efficiency of your supply chain.

## Getting started with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

If you're interested in using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to streamline your supply chain, there are a few steps you'll need to take.

### Step 1: Implement EPCIS 2.0

To start, you'll need to implement EPCIS 2.0. This involves configuring your systems to send and receive standardized event data using the EPCIS 2.0 standard.

### Step 2: Implement CBVs

Once you've implemented EPCIS 2.0, you'll need to implement CBVs. This involves configuring your systems to use the standardized language for describing different events in your supply chain.

### Step 3: Integrate with your existing systems

Once you've implemented EPCIS 2.0 and CBVs, you'll need to integrate them with your existing supply chain systems. This may involve working with suppliers, retailers, and other partners to ensure that everyone is using the same standards.

### Step 4: Monitor and optimize

Finally, you'll need to monitor and optimize your supply chain using the data you collect through EPCIS 2.0 and CBVs. This includes identifying inefficiencies and taking steps to address them, as well as tracking key metrics such as delivery times and inventory levels.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can be powerful tools for streamlining your supply chain, improving visibility, and reducing inefficiencies. By using standardized event data, you can gain a better understanding of what's happening at each stage of your supply chain, communicate more effectively with partners, and reduce the risk of errors or misunderstandings.

If you're interested in using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in your own supply chain, the steps are relatively straightforward. By implementing these standards, you can take a big step towards optimizing your supply chain and reducing costs.
