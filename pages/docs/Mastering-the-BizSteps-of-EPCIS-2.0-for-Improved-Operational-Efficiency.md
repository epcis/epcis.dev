## Mastering the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0 for Improved Operational Efficiency

Managing the supply chain is a complex challenge. One of the keys to success in this field is to be able to track and trace products throughout their lifecycle. This is where the EPCIS 2.0 standard comes in handy. This standard provides a standardized way to share information about the location, status, and movement of products across the supply chain. To make use of this standard fully, it is essential to master the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0. In this blog post, we will explore these steps in detail and learn how we can apply them to improve our operational efficiency.

### What are BizSteps?

In EPCIS 2.0, BizSteps are the core building blocks of the business processes that take place in the supply chain. They provide a standardized way to describe and represent these processes. Each BizStep has a name and a set of attributes that define the relevant information to be associated with it. There are six standard BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, and they are as follows:

1. Read
2. Receive
3. Transform
4. Aggregation
5. Shipping
6. Ownership

### Mastering the Six BizSteps

#### 1. Read

The Read BizStep represents the point at which data about a product is captured. This data can include information about the product's origin, manufacturer, and SKU, among other things. The Read BizStep can be triggered by various devices, such as RFID readers, bar code scanners, or GPS trackers. The data gathered at this stage is crucial for tracking the products throughout the supply chain.

#### 2. Receive

The Receive BizStep represents the point at which a product is received into a specific location, such as a warehouse or store. This step captures information about the date and time of the product's arrival, as well as the location it arrived at. This step is essential for managing inventory and ensuring that products are in the right place and ready for distribution.

#### 3. Transform

The Transform BizStep represents the point at which a product changes its state or form. This can include processes such as mixing or packaging. This step captures information about the product's new form and can trigger subsequent BizSteps, such as Aggregation or Shipping.

#### 4. Aggregation

The Aggregation BizStep represents the point at which individual products are grouped together to form a larger unit, such as a case or pallet. This step captures information about the quantity of products and the new group's unique identifier. This step is essential for managing inventory, ensuring product quality, and tracking products' movement throughout the supply chain.

#### 5. Shipping

The Shipping BizStep represents the point at which a product is shipped from one location to another. This can include the movement of a product from a warehouse to a store or from one store to another. This step captures information about the date and time of shipping and the location the product is being shipped to.

#### 6. Ownership

The Ownership BizStep represents the point at which ownership of a product changes hands. This can occur during the sale of a product or when a product is transferred from one entity to another. This step captures information about the new owner and can trigger subsequent BizSteps, such as Shipping or Aggregation.

### Implementing the BizSteps

To implement the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0, organizations must identify the key business processes that take place within their supply chain. They must then map these processes to the standard BizSteps and identify the information to be associated with each BizStep. This information should then be captured at the appropriate stages of the process using the appropriate devices or tools.

Once the information has been captured, it must be stored securely in a centralized location, such as a database. This information should then be made available to all relevant stakeholders in the supply chain, such as partners, suppliers, and customers, to enable them to track and trace products throughout the supply chain.

### Benefits of Implementing the BizSteps

Implementing the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0 can yield several benefits for organizations. These include:

#### Improved Operational Efficiency

By tracking products throughout the supply chain, organizations can identify areas for improvement and optimize their processes accordingly. This can lead to cost savings, reduced waste, and improved customer satisfaction.

#### Increased Transparency and Visibility

By providing stakeholders with access to real-time data about products' location and status, organizations can increase transparency and visibility throughout the supply chain. This can improve relationships with partners and customers, leading to increased loyalty and repeat business.

#### Better Traceability and Compliance

Tracking products throughout the supply chain can help organizations comply with regulatory requirements, such as those related to food safety or pharmaceuticals. This can lead to decreased risk of fines or legal action, as well as increased trust in the organization among stakeholders.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0 is essential for organizations looking to optimize their supply chain management. By implementing the standard BizSteps and capturing relevant information at the appropriate stages of the process, organizations can improve their operational efficiency, increase transparency and visibility, and achieve better traceability and compliance. As such, the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0 represent a valuable tool for organizations looking to stay ahead in an increasingly complex and competitive market.
