# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV in the Context of Blockchain Technology

The increasing adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain management systems has led to the emergence of newer standards that aim to improve the visibility and transparency of the movement of goods across various stages in the supply chain. One of the latest standards in this regard is the EPCIS 2.0, which stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services version 2.0. This standard builds upon the foundation of the EPCIS 1.0, and it adds important value propositions such as the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) that enriches the meaning of data exchanged within the supply chain. In this blog post, we will discuss how EPCIS 2.0, in conjunction with the CBV, can benefit blockchain-based supply chain management solutions.

## Background

The EPCIS standard was developed by GS1, a non-profit organization that develops barcodes and data standards for businesses. EPCIS defines a standard for the sharing of information about the movement and status of physical objects as they travel through a supply chain, using Electronic Product Codes (EPCs). EPCs are unique identifiers that are assigned to physical objects, such as products or packages, and they enable the tracking and tracing of these objects as they move through the supply chain.

The EPCIS 1.0 standard was released in 2007, and it defined a set of interfaces for capturing and sharing data about physical objects and events as they travel through the supply chain. However, EPCIS 1.0 had some limitations, such as the lack of standardization in the data structures and the inability to capture certain types of events. For example, EPCIS 1.0 did not provide a standard way of tracking the temperature or humidity levels of a product during transportation.

To address these limitations, GS1 released EPCIS 2.0 in 2018, which introduced several new features and improvements over the previous version.

## EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is an event-based standard that enables the collection and sharing of data about events that occur in the supply chain. EPCIS 2.0 provides a standardized way of capturing and sharing data about events, such as the shipment of a product or the delivery of a package. The standard defines a set of interfaces for capturing event data and sharing it with other systems in the supply chain.

EPCIS 2.0 also introduces a new concept called the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). The CBV provides a standardized way of describing the meaning of data exchanged within the supply chain. It defines a set of standard terms and definitions for key data elements that are often used in the supply chain, such as product codes, location codes, and date/time stamps.

The CBV provides several benefits for supply chain management systems, such as:

- Improved data accuracy: By using a standardized set of terms and definitions, it ensures that data exchanged between different systems is accurate and consistent.
- Increased interoperability: Standardized data enables different systems in the supply chain to exchange data seamlessly, reducing errors and inefficiencies.
- Enriched meaning of data: By defining standard terms and definitions, it enriches the meaning of data exchanged within the supply chain, providing more context and making it more useful.

## EPCIS 2.0 and Blockchain Technology

The decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology makes it an ideal fit for supply chain management systems. Blockchain enables the creation of a shared ledger that all participants in the supply chain can access, providing a single source of truth for transactions and events. Blockchain also enables the creation of smart contracts that automate certain processes in the supply chain, such as the payment of invoices or the tracking of shipments.

EPCIS 2.0, in conjunction with the CBV, can enhance the benefits of blockchain technology in supply chain management systems. The use of standardized data and event-based tracking can provide a higher level of transparency and visibility into the movement of goods across the supply chain. The enriched meaning of data provided by the CBV can improve the accuracy and consistency of the data exchanged within the blockchain network, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the supply chain.

Additionally, EPCIS 2.0 can enable the tracking of additional data points that are not currently supported by blockchain technology. For example, EPCIS 2.0 can enable the tracking of temperature or humidity levels during transportation, providing valuable insights into the condition of goods during transit. This information can be used to ensure that the quality of the goods is maintained throughout the supply chain, reducing waste and improving customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0, in conjunction with the CBV, can provide significant benefits for blockchain-based supply chain management systems. The use of standardized data and event-based tracking can increase the transparency and visibility of the supply chain, while the enriched meaning of data provided by the CBV can improve the accuracy and consistency of the data exchanged within the blockchain network. Together, EPCIS 2.0 and blockchain technology can provide a powerful solution for improving the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the supply chain.
