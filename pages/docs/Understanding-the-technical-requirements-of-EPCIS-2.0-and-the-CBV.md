# Understanding the Technical Requirements of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a global standard for the exchange of information related to the movement and visibility of goods in a supply chain. It provides a common language for disparate systems to communicate and share information about the location, status, and history of products. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of this standard and includes new features, such as the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) that makes it even more powerful.

In this blog post, weâ€™ll take a deep dive into the technical requirements of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV.

## EPCIS 2.0 Overview

The EPCIS 2.0 specification defines a set of interfaces that enable the exchange of event data between trading partners in a synchronized way. These interfaces are divided into two main categories:

- Query Interfaces: Allows a client system to search for relevant data that has been previously recorded in an EPCIS 2.0 repository.
- Capture Interfaces: Allows a system to capture events and write them to an EPCIS 2.0 repository in a standardized format.

EPCIS 2.0 is designed to work with a variety of data standards, including GS1 EPC (Electronic Product Code) and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) messages. The goal of EPCIS 2.0 is to provide a common standard for capturing and sharing event data, regardless of the underlying data format.

## Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is an essential component of EPCIS 2.0 that defines a standard set of terms for describing various aspects of supply chain events. The CBV specification includes a set of predefined vocabulary terms and provides guidelines for creating new terms when necessary.

The CBV is designed to be flexible and scalable so that organizations can customize it to fit their specific supply chain needs. For example, users can add new terms or modify existing ones to reflect the unique data requirements of their organization.

The CBV includes several categories of vocabulary terms, including:

- Object Event Types: Describes events related to physical objects, such as the receipt or shipment of goods.
- Aggregation Event Types: Describes events related to the grouping of objects, such as the creation of a new package or pallet.
- Quantity Event Types: Describes events related to changes in the quantity of an object, such as the addition or removal of items from a package.
- Transaction Event Types: Describes events related to business transactions, such as the issuance of a purchase order or an invoice.

## EPCIS 2.0 Technical Requirements

To implement EPCIS 2.0, a system must meet several technical requirements, including:

- Support for XML or JSON data formats: EPCIS 2.0 supports both XML and JSON data formats. A system must be able to send and receive event data in both formats.
- Support for HTTPS transport: All communication between systems must be secured using HTTPS.
- Support for Query and Capture interfaces: A system must support both the Query and Capture interfaces defined by the EPCIS 2.0 specification.
- Implementation of CBV vocabulary terms: To ensure interoperability between systems, a system must implement the CBV vocabulary terms according to the EPCIS 2.0 specification.
- Support for data validation and error handling: A system must validate all event data before processing and provide appropriate error handling mechanisms.

## Benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

Implementing EPCIS 2.0 and utilizing the CBV provides several benefits to organizations, including:

- Improved supply chain visibility: By standardizing event data across the supply chain, organizations can gain better visibility into the movement and status of goods.
- Increased operational efficiency: By implementing a common standard for event data, organizations can reduce the time and resources required to integrate with trading partners.
- Better traceability: The use of standardized event data enables organizations to track the movement of goods throughout the supply chain, providing greater traceability and accountability.
- Enhanced data accuracy: By providing a common language for communicating event data, organizations can reduce the risk of errors and data inaccuracies.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV offer a powerful standard for exchanging supply chain event data in a consistent, secure, and scalable way. By implementing these standards, organizations can gain improved visibility, increased efficiency, and enhanced traceability throughout their supply chain.

To implement EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV successfully, organizations must ensure their systems meet the technical requirements outlined in the specification. This includes support for both XML and JSON data formats, HTTPS transport, Query and Capture interfaces, and adherence to the CBV vocabulary terms.

As more organizations adopt EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, we can expect to see greater interoperability and standardization throughout the supply chain, resulting in reduced costs, increased efficiency, and improved customer satisfaction.
