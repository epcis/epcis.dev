# What Are BizSteps and How Do They Enhance EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is a technology framework that facilitates the exchange of information between supply chain partners to improve the traceability of goods. BizSteps is a concept developed by GS1, the global standards organization, to enhance the functionality of EPCIS 2.0 by providing a common language for describing the different steps in a supply chain.

In this blog post, we will explore in detail what BizSteps are, their significance, how they enhance EPCIS 2.0, and their practical applications in the supply chain.

## What Are BizSteps?

BizSteps, as mentioned above, provide a common language for describing the different steps in a supply chain. In essence, BizSteps are a standardized set of terms that can be used across industries and supply chains to describe events or actions that take place during the life cycle of a product. These events could include the manufacture, packaging, distribution, storage, transportation, and sale of the product.

To ensure consistency and accuracy, the BizSteps vocabulary is maintained by GS1, the same organization behind EPCIS 2.0. The vocabulary consists of predefined terms that can be used to describe the attributes of a particular step in the supply chain. For example, the BizStep term for 'manufacturing' is 'urn:epcglobal:cbv:bizstep:manufacture', which can be used to describe the attributes of the manufacturing process such as the date, time, location, and quantity produced.

Using standardized vocabulary to describe supply chain events can help organizations streamline their data collection and sharing processes. This is because it helps to eliminate ambiguity and redundancy in data collection, making it easier for partners to interpret and use the information.

## How Do BizSteps Enhance EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is a powerful framework for supply chain traceability, but its potential is limited without a standardized vocabulary to describe the different steps in the supply chain. This is where BizSteps come in- by providing a common language for describing actions and events in the supply chain, BizSteps enhance the functionality of EPCIS 2.0 and facilitate easy collaboration between partners.

BizSteps enable improved tracking of products along the supply chain by linking the different steps of a product's life cycle. This enables parties in the supply chain to track and trace products with ease, enabling quick and efficient management of inventory, as well as improving the accuracy of recall and anti-counterfeiting efforts. 

## Practical Applications of BizSteps in Supply Chain Management

So, how can businesses leverage the use of BizSteps in their supply chain management? Here are a few practical applications:

### Improved Visibility and Transparency in the Supply Chain

By using standardized vocabulary to describe events along the supply chain, businesses can improve the visibility and transparency of their operations. This is because BizSteps facilitate the creation of a common language or format that partners can use to capture key data points such as time, date, location, and quantity, among others. This makes it easier to track products and inventory, monitor supply chain operations, and ensure compliance with regulations and standards.

### Faster and More Accurate Recall Management 

BizSteps also enhance the speed and accuracy of recall management. For example, in the event of a product recall, all stakeholders in the supply chain can quickly access and review the relevant BizSteps data to trace the movement of the affected products back to their source. This makes it possible to quickly identify and isolate affected products, minimizing the risk of harm to consumers, and reducing the impact of the recall on the business.

### Improved Anti-Counterfeiting Efforts

Counterfeit products are often difficult to detect because they may be made to look like genuine products, making it challenging to track their movement and identify their source. By using BizSteps to track the movement of genuine products from the manufacturer to the end consumer, businesses can more easily detect and prevent counterfeit products from entering the market.

### Streamlined Supply Chain Operations

Finally, businesses can use BizSteps to streamline their supply chain operations, making the process of collecting and sharing data more efficient. This helps businesses to save time and resources, reduce errors associated with manual data entry, and improve the quality of data collected. With better data, businesses can make more informed decisions, and optimize their supply chains to better meet customer needs.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, BizSteps are a critical component of EPCIS 2.0, enabling businesses to describe and track different events and actions that take place when products move through the supply chain. By providing a standardized vocabulary for describing these events, businesses can improve the accuracy, transparency, and efficiency of their supply chain operations. As supply chains become more complex, it is more important than ever to have effective data collection, sharing, and analysis systems in place. BizSteps offer businesses a powerful tool to manage and optimize their supply chains and streamline their operations.
