# The Role of CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0: Latest Advances and Best Practices

The Global Standards One (GS1) electronic product code information services (EPCIS) is a global standard designed to facilitate the sharing of item-level data across the supply chain. With EPCIS 2.0, GS1 has introduced a new feature known as the core business vocabulary (CBV). In this blog post, we will explore what CBV is, its role in EPCIS 2.0, and best practices for its implementation.

## Introduction to CBV

CBV is an essential component of EPCIS 2.0. It's a standardized vocabulary that describes the different kinds of data that can be captured and shared using EPCIS 2.0. CBV includes terminology for products, events, and locations, which provides consistency across different industries, organizations, and countries. It enables a standardized approach to EPCIS 2.0 implementation, eliminating the need for custom vocabularies.

CBV also provides clear definitions for different data elements, which is vital in ensuring that organizations have a common understanding of the data they are sharing. For example, CBV defines what constitutes a "shipment," enabling parties in a supply chain to record and share shipment data consistently.

## CBV Benefits

CBV provides significant benefits to organizations using EPCIS 2.0. Some of these benefits include:

### Consistency

CBV creates consistent standards across different organizations, industries, and countries. This consistency ensures that data can be shared easily between trading partners, eliminating the need for custom vocabularies.

### Efficiency

By providing clear, concise definitions and standards that all parties in the supply chain can understand, CBV streamlines operations, reducing errors and delays.

### Better Analytics

CBV helps companies extract value from their data. The standardized vocabulary means that data is captured consistently, making it easier to analyze, compare, and draw insights.

## Latest Advances in CBV

CBV was initially introduced in EPCIS 1.1. However, with the advent of EPCIS 2.0, GS1 has extended and improved CBV in several ways.

### Extension of Vocabulary

Under EPCIS 2.0, the range of CBV terminology has been extended beyond products, events, and locations. New categories, including "business steps" and "physical states," have been introduced.

### Improved Compliance

The enhanced CBV in EPCIS 2.0 has significantly improved compliance. Since CBV provides a standardized approach to data sharing, adopting it helps eliminate the need for custom vocabularies, delivering consistency across different industries, organizations, and countries.

### Improved Interoperability

EPCIS 2.0's advanced CBV facilitates interoperability between different organizations in the supply chain. With the standardized vocabulary and clear definitions, organizations can exchange data seamlessly. In turn, this reduces the need for custom mappings and connectors, saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors.

## Best Practices for CBV Implementation

### Understand the Vocabulary

To achieve the full benefits of CBV, it's essential to understand its different terminologies fully. GS1 provides training resources to help organizations adopt CBV successfully.

### Customization

While CBV provides a standardized vocabulary, it may not always be suitable for all organizations' needs. As such, customization may be necessary to meet specific requirements.

Customization should be minimized to avoid creating non-standardized routines that could hinder interoperability. In cases where customization is necessary, organizations should follow best practices to ensure that their vocabulary's extensions comply with CBV's definitions.

### Version Control

Organizations should implement version control when creating or customizing their CBV. This ensures that the vocabulary remains up to date and in sync with the latest version of EPCIS 2.0.

### Appropriate Use

Organizations using EPCIS 2.0 with CBV must ensure that data elements are used appropriately. For example, organizations should not use the same element to capture multiple pieces of information.

### Standardization

To achieve maximum benefits from CBV, it's vital to adhere to standardization rules. Organizations should maintain the vocabulary's integrity by following the set rules and avoiding creating multiple variations of the same vocabulary.

## Final Thoughts

CBV is a crucial component of EPCIS 2.0. Its standardized vocabulary has significantly improved interoperability and consistency across different organizations, industries, and countries. While CBV may require customization for some organizations' specific needs, it's essential to follow best practices and work to maintain its integrity.

By adopting CBV, the supply chain can grow faster, become more efficient, and operate more transparently, ultimately resulting in improved services and increased value for all stakeholders.
