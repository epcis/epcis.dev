# Defining the Role of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 for Consumer Goods

## Introduction

In the world of supply chain management, traceability of products is crucial for ensuring safety, quality, and compliance. The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard is a widely adopted solution for managing traceability of products. EPCIS provides a framework for sharing information about product movements and events across organizations in real-time. The latest version of EPCIS, EPCIS 2.0, introduces a new concept called BizSteps, which aims to improve the accuracy of product tracing. In this blog post, we will define the role of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 for consumer goods.

## What are BizSteps?

In EPCIS 2.0, BizSteps are defined as business steps that are taken by an organization in the process of handling and transporting a product. A BizStep represents a specific action that was taken on a product, such as receiving, storing, shipping, or packaging. Each BizStep includes a set of attributes that provide additional details about the action. These attributes may include location, time, personnel, and other relevant data.

The goal of BizSteps is to improve the accuracy of product traceability by providing a more detailed view of the product's journey through the supply chain. By capturing the business steps taken by each organization along the way, EPCIS 2.0 can provide a complete picture of the product's history, from initial production to final consumption.

## How do BizSteps work?

Let's consider an example to illustrate how BizSteps work. Imagine that a manufacturer produces a batch of cookies and ships them to a distributor. The distributor receives the cookies, stores them in a warehouse, and later ships them to a retailer. The retailer receives the cookies and sells them to consumers.

In EPCIS 2.0, each of these actions represents a BizStep. The manufacturer's BizStep would be "Produced", with attributes such as the production date, lot number, and packaging details. The distributor's BizStep would be "Received", with attributes such as the date of receipt, storage location, and quantity received. Similarly, the retailer's BizStep would be "Sold", with attributes such as the date of sale, retail price, and customer details.

By capturing each of these BizSteps and their associated attributes, EPCIS 2.0 can provide a complete view of the product's movements from production to consumption. This information can be used to track the product's origin, quality, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## The Benefits of BizSteps for Consumer Goods

There are several benefits of using BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 for consumer goods:

### Improved Traceability

BizSteps provide a more detailed view of product movements, making it easier to trace the product's journey from production to consumption. By capturing each organization's business steps, EPCIS 2.0 can provide a more accurate and complete view of the product's history.

### Enhanced Quality Control

BizSteps can help organizations to identify quality issues at an earlier stage in the supply chain. By tracking the product's movements and events, organizations can quickly identify the source of any quality problems and take corrective action.

### Increased Efficiency

BizSteps can improve supply chain efficiency by providing real-time visibility into product movements. Organizations can use this information to optimize their supply chain processes, reduce waste, and improve customer service.

### Compliance with Regulations

BizSteps can help organizations to comply with regulatory requirements, such as those related to food safety, quality, and traceability. By capturing and sharing information about product movements and events, organizations can demonstrate compliance with these requirements.

## Implementing BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0

Implementing BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 requires careful planning and coordination among organizations in the supply chain. Here are some key steps to consider:

### 1. Define the Business Steps

Organizations should agree on the business steps that they will capture in EPCIS 2.0. This may include receiving, storing, shipping, packaging, and other relevant actions. Each organization should define the attributes that they will capture for each BizStep.

### 2. Agree on Data Standards

To ensure interoperability among organizations, it is important to agree on data standards for BizSteps. This may include standardizing attribute names, data formats, and terminology.

### 3. Establish Data Sharing Agreements

Organizations must agree on how they will share BizSteps data with each other. This may include establishing data sharing agreements, setting up data exchange systems, and ensuring data privacy and security.

### 4. Implement EPCIS 2.0-compliant Systems

Organizations must implement EPCIS 2.0-compliant systems to capture and share BizSteps data. This may include upgrading existing systems or implementing new ones.

### 5. Test and Validate

Organizations should test and validate their EPCIS 2.0-compliant systems to ensure that they are capturing and sharing BizSteps data accurately and effectively.

## Conclusion

BizSteps are a powerful tool for improving the accuracy of product tracing in EPCIS 2.0. By capturing each organization's business steps in the supply chain, EPCIS 2.0 can provide a complete view of the product's history from production to consumption. This information can be used to enhance traceability, quality control, supply chain efficiency, and compliance with regulatory requirements. However, implementing BizSteps requires careful planning and coordination among organizations in the supply chain. By following the key steps outlined in this blog post, organizations can successfully implement BizSteps and reap the benefits of this powerful new feature in EPCIS 2.0.
