# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV for Risk Management in Supply Chains

In today's digital age, supply chains have become increasingly complex, global and automated. With this complexity, comes the challenge of managing risk and ensuring transparency throughout the supply chain. There are various tools and solutions available to help mitigate risk in supply chains, but few have gained as much traction as Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV).

In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore the benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV for risk management in supply chains, and how it can transform your business.

## Overview of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

Before diving into the specifics of how EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can help manage risk in supply chains, let's take a brief overview of what these technologies are.

### EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is a standard that was developed by GS1, a not-for-profit organization that sets global standards for businesses. It is a protocol that enables businesses to share and track supply chain data in real-time, using a common language. EPCIS 2.0 provides a standardized way for businesses to capture, share and exchange information about supply chain events, such as shipment details, inventory levels, and product authenticity.

With EPCIS 2.0, businesses can make their supply chain more visible, enabling them to identify and address issues promptly, reducing the potential for disruptions, delays and lost revenue.

### CBV

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of standardized terminology, developed by GS1, to define concepts used in business transactions, such as product identification and location. CBV is designed to enable businesses to exchange information in a consistent way, ensuring that each party has a clear understanding of the meaning behind the data.

CBV provides a foundation for businesses to exchange data using a common language, enabling them to track and manage their products and shipments more effectively.

## Benefits of Using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Risk Management

Now that we understand what EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are let's explore why they are particularly beneficial for managing risk in supply chains.

### Improved Supply Chain Visibility

One of the main benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is improved supply chain visibility. By using a common language to track and manage supply chain events, businesses can gain real-time insights into the location and condition of goods at any point in the supply chain.

This improved visibility enables businesses to identify issues quickly, such as delays or disruptions, and respond proactively to mitigate the potential impact on their operations. This capability is particularly important for businesses that have complex supply chains, involving multiple parties, locations and products.

### Reduced Risk of Counterfeit Products

Counterfeit products can cause significant damage to a brand's reputation, particularly in industries such as pharmaceuticals, where counterfeit products can pose a significant health risk. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help businesses reduce the risk of counterfeit products by enabling them to track their products' authenticity throughout the supply chain process.

Using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, businesses can create unique product identification codes that enable them to monitor and track the product's journey from manufacture to consumption. This method enables businesses to verify the authenticity of their products, reducing the likelihood of counterfeit products entering the supply chain.

### Improved Compliance with Regulations

Managing compliance with regulations can be a significant challenge for businesses in heavily regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, and consumer goods. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can provide a solution to this challenge, by enabling businesses to track and monitor their products throughout the supply chain, ensuring that they meet relevant regulations.

This method allows businesses to provide regulators with accurate and comprehensive data, demonstrating their compliance with regulations. This capability is particularly important for businesses that operate across multiple jurisdictions, each with different compliance requirements.

### Better Data Analysis and Decision Making

Data analytics plays a crucial role in modern business operations. By using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to track and monitor supply chain data, businesses can gain real-time insights into their operations, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to optimize their operations.

This capability also enables businesses to identify patterns and trends quickly, helping them to respond proactively to emerging issues and opportunities. By using data analytics, businesses can reduce the risk of disruption and ensure that they remain competitive in their respective markets.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are powerful tools that can help businesses manage risk in their supply chains. By making supply chain events more visible and providing a common language for data exchange, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV enable businesses to improve product authenticity, reduce the risk of disruptions and delays, and better comply with regulatory requirements.

With the increased complexity of modern supply chains, businesses need to have the right tools to manage risk effectively. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide a reliable and proven solution to this challenge, enabling businesses to optimize their operations, reduce risk, and remain competitive.
