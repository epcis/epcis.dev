# The role of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV in food safety

Food safety is of crucial concern for both consumers and industry stakeholders in the food supply chain. Ensuring that food products are safe for consumption is not only a moral and ethical imperative but also a regulatory requirement. Many regulations in place dictate strict traceability requirements for food products, starting from their origin to the point of consumption. This article explores the role of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) in the food industry and how they can help improve food safety.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, and it is a standard developed by GS1 for real-time sharing of supply chain information across the industry. EPCIS 2.0 is a more recent version of the standard that focuses on improving the visibility and accuracy of supply chain data. 

EPCIS 2.0 provides a comprehensive framework for exchanging event-based data within and across companies. It does so by enabling interoperability between different systems used by various stakeholders in the supply chain. By providing a consistent format for data sharing, EPCIS 2.0 can help improve traceability, compliance, and operational efficiency.

EPCIS 2.0 provides a standard format for tracking information about products as they move through the supply chain. This information can include the origin of the product, its current location, and any other relevant events or data points. This data can be used to identify potential safety hazards, track the source of an outbreak, or monitor compliance with regulatory requirements.

## What is CBV?

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a standard used to describe business processes and activities. It provides a common vocabulary that can be used to describe events and transactions in the supply chain. CBV helps establish a common language for stakeholders in the supply chain, reducing ambiguity and improving efficiency.

CBV provides a standard way of describing the events and activities that take place in the supply chain. This common language can be used to exchange information with different stakeholders and systems, improving interoperability and reducing communication errors.

## How EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can improve food safety

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can play a significant role in improving food safety in several different ways. First, they can provide end-to-end traceability, enabling stakeholders to track the origin of food products and their movements through the supply chain. This can help identify potential safety hazards early, potentially preventing outbreaks or product recalls.

Second, by providing a common language and standard format for data exchange, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can improve communication between different stakeholders in the supply chain. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to food safety requirements and can reduce the potential for miscommunication and errors.

Third, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help ensure compliance with regulations related to food safety. These standards enable the tracking of key information, such as the origin of food products, their storage conditions, and any relevant testing or inspection results. This information can be used to ensure that products meet regulatory requirements and prevent unsafe products from entering the market.

## Case studies

Several companies in the food industry have already started implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to improve food safety. Below are some examples of how these standards are being used in practice.

### Nestle

Nestle has implemented a system using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to track the origin and movement of raw materials used in chocolate production. The system provides end-to-end traceability and enables Nestle to monitor the conditions of raw materials as they move through the supply chain. By doing so, Nestle can identify any potential safety hazards early and take appropriate action.

### Walmart

Walmart is a major proponent of EPCIS 2.0 and has been using the standard to improve food safety across its supply chain. Walmart uses EPCIS 2.0 to track the movement of fresh produce from suppliers to stores. The system enables Walmart to quickly identify the source of any safety issues and remove contaminated products from the market.

### Carrefour

Carrefour, a major retailer in Europe, has implemented a blockchain-based system that utilizes EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to track the origin and movement of food products. The system provides end-to-end traceability and enables Carrefour to quickly identify any potential safety hazards.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are valuable tools in improving food safety in the food supply chain. By providing a common language and standard format for data exchange, these standards can help stakeholders better track the origin of food products, monitor their movement through the supply chain, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Companies in the food industry that implement these standards can reduce the potential for safety hazards and recalls, improving the safety of the food supply for consumers.
