# How GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Simplify Supply Chain Management

The supply chain has become increasingly complex over the past few years. With the rise of e-commerce and globalization of supply chains, it has become challenging for businesses to track the flow of goods throughout their supply chain. This is why the use of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV has become essential for simplifying supply chain management.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a standard developed by GS1, a not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains standards for supply chain management. EPCIS is used to capture and share information about the movement of goods, from the point of origin to the point of consumption.

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the standard, which was released in 2019. It builds upon the previous version of EPCIS, but with additional features and functionalities.

## What is CBV?

CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a standardized vocabulary that defines the terms used in supply chain management. It provides a common language for communicating supply chain data between different parties in the supply chain.

CBV was also developed by GS1 and is designed to work with EPCIS. By using CBV, businesses can ensure that all data exchanged between trading partners is consistent and accurate.

## How do GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Work Together?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV work together to simplify the exchange of supply chain data between different parties.

Using EPCIS, businesses can capture and share information about the movement of goods through the supply chain. This information can include:

- The type of product being shipped
- The location of the product within the supply chain
- The status of the product (e.g., shipped, received, in transit)
- The date and time of each event in the supply chain

CBV provides a standard vocabulary for describing this information. This helps to ensure that all trading partners are using the same terminology when exchanging data. For example, if one trading partner refers to a "pallet" of goods, while another refers to it as a "shipment," this could lead to confusion and errors.

By using CBV, businesses can ensure that all data exchanged is consistent and accurate. This makes it easier to track the movement of goods through the supply chain and to identify any issues or delays.

## Benefits of Using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

The use of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV offers several benefits for supply chain management.

### Improved Visibility

One of the biggest advantages of using EPCIS and CBV is improved visibility into the supply chain. By capturing and sharing real-time data about the movement of goods, businesses can gain insights into the performance of their supply chain.

With this information, they can identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies and take steps to address them. For example, if a particular warehouse is consistently delayed in processing shipments, the business can investigate the issue and take steps to improve performance.

### Increased Efficiency

By simplifying the exchange of supply chain data, EPCIS and CBV can also increase efficiency. Instead of spending time manually entering or reconciling data, businesses can automate this process and focus on more value-added activities.

This can help to reduce errors and improve the speed at which data is exchanged between trading partners. For example, if a shipment is delayed or goes missing, this information can be quickly shared between trading partners so that the issue can be addressed.

### Greater Collaboration

Finally, the use of EPCIS and CBV promotes greater collaboration between trading partners. By using a common language and standard format for exchanging data, businesses can work together more effectively.

This can lead to better communication, faster problem-solving, and improved relationships between trading partners. Ultimately, this can lead to a more efficient and effective supply chain.

## Conclusion

The use of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is essential for simplifying supply chain management in today's complex business environment. By providing a standardized way to capture and share data, businesses can gain visibility, improve efficiency, and promote greater collaboration between trading partners.

As the supply chain continues to evolve, the use of EPCIS and CBV is likely to become even more important for businesses looking to stay competitive in the global marketplace.
