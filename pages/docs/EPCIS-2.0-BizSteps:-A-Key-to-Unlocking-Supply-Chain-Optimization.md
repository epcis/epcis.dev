# EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps: A Key to Unlocking Supply Chain Optimization

The success of any supply chain depends on the level of transparency, visibility, and traceability, which enables businesses to make data-driven decisions. Interestingly, today, we're experiencing a tremendous shift in the way businesses conduct their operations, and this has prompted a growing demand for more efficient systems that can support real-time tracking and supply chain optimization.

One vital technology that's been developed in recent years is the Electronic Product Code Information System (EPCIS) 2.0. It's a supply chain visibility and traceability standard developed by the GS1 organization, and it's proving to be a key player in the quest for optimizing supply chains.

One aspect of EPCIS 2.0 that's gaining relevance is the use of BizSteps, and in this blog post, we will discuss how BizSteps can help unlock supply chain optimization.

## Understanding BizSteps

BizSteps refer to the standard process steps that both trading partners and supply chain systems can use to define the workflow of the EPCIS events. In other words, BizSteps highlights the specific sequences of events that occur along the supply chain, and it provides a rich set of functionalities for capturing event metadata that can be used for tracking and analysis.

The BizSteps concept was introduced to EPCIS 2.0 to create a standardized and consistent way to describe supply chain processes across different industries. It allows diverse systems to collaborate seamlessly while ensuring that the outcome of the data-exchange still follows considerable functional semantic integrity that is used to provide a common business process view.

Overall, BizSteps enable businesses to collaborate more efficiently and align their processes to ensure that transactions are executed in a more coordinated manner, with relevant process information shared transparently.

## The Role of BizSteps in Supply Chain Optimization

One of the biggest roadblocks that businesses face when optimizing their supply chains is the lack of transparency, which hampers decision-making processes. However, with EPCIS 2.0's BizSteps, businesses can achieve a high level of transparency within their supply chains.

BizSteps can be used to monitor the movement of goods and the status of a product along its journey through the supply chain. By defining a set of standard process steps, businesses can track the progress of products through different stages of the supply chain in real-time. This makes it easy to identify bottlenecks, eliminate inefficiencies and optimize the supply chain's performance.
