# Understanding GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV: A Comprehensive Guide


## Introduction

In the world of supply chain management, it is imperative to have a system in place that can track products and inventory in real time. This is where GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV come into play. GS1 EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a global standard that enables businesses to track products as they move through the supply chain. CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a set of standard labels that allow different trading partners to exchange data with a common vocabulary. 

In this blog post, we will provide a comprehensive guide to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, starting with an overview of what they are, their key features, and how they work together to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility. We will also explore the benefits and use cases of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, and discuss the challenges in implementing them.
