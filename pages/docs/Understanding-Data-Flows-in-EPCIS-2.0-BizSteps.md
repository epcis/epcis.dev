# Understanding Data Flows in EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a global standard for tracking and sharing information about products as they move throughout the supply chain. It enables businesses to gain better visibility into their supply chain operations, improve traceability, and enhance inventory management. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of this standard, which introduces new features and enhancements to the previous version. One of the core components of the EPCIS 2.0 standard is the BizSteps, which define the processes and events that occur in the supply chain. In this blog post, we will take a deeper look at the data flows in EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps and how they enable better supply chain management.

## Overview of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

BizSteps are the building blocks of the EPCIS 2.0 standard. They define the various processes that occur in the supply chain, such as manufacturing, transportation, and delivery. BizSteps are designed to be flexible and can be customized to meet the specific needs of different supply chains. The standard defines several pre-defined BizSteps, such as "Packaging," "Transport," and "Receipt," but users can also define their own BizSteps as needed.

One of the main advantages of BizSteps is their ability to capture granular data about the supply chain processes. For example, the "Transport" BizStep can capture information about the mode of transportation, the carrier, the vehicle ID, the driver, and the route taken. This level of detail enables businesses to gain better visibility into their supply chain operations and identify areas for improvement.

## Data Flows in EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps are designed to capture a wide range of data about the supply chain processes. This includes information about the products being tracked, as well as information about the actors and locations involved in the process. In addition, BizSteps capture information about the time and date of each event, allowing businesses to track the movement of products in real-time.

The data flows in EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps are based on a standard format that is designed to facilitate interoperability between different systems. Each BizStep consists of a set of data elements, such as "eventTime" and "bizLocation," which are defined in a standard format. This enables different systems to exchange information about the supply chain processes, regardless of the specific technologies or platforms they are using.

## Example Data Flows

To better understand the data flows in EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps, let's look at an example of a supply chain process. In this example, we will track the process of a product being manufactured, packaged, and shipped to a retail store.

### Manufacturing

The first step in the supply chain process is manufacturing. The manufacturing process is defined as a BizStep in EPCIS 2.0 and captures information about the products being manufactured, as well as the time and location of the process. The data captured in this step might include:

- Product ID
- Quantity produced
- Manufacturing location
- Start time and end time of the process

### Packaging

After the manufacturing process is complete, the products are typically packaged for shipment. Packaging is also defined as a BizStep in EPCIS 2.0 and captures information about the packaging process, such as:

- Product ID
- Quantity packaged
- Packaging location
- Start time and end time of the process

### Transportation

Once the products are packaged, they are typically transported to a warehouse or retail store. Transportation is another BizStep in EPCIS 2.0 and captures information about the transportation process, such as:

- Product ID
- Quantity transported
- Carrier information
- Origin and destination locations
- Start time and end time of the process

### Receipt

Finally, when the products arrive at the warehouse or store, they are received and scanned into inventory. Receipt is a pre-defined BizStep in EPCIS 2.0 and captures information about the receipt process, such as:

- Product ID
- Quantity received
- Receiving location
- Start time and end time of the process

## Benefits of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

The data flows in EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps provide businesses with several benefits, including:

### Better Visibility

BizSteps enable businesses to gain better visibility into their supply chain operations. By capturing granular data about each process, businesses can identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement. They can also track the movement of products in real-time, which can help to prevent delays and disruptions in the supply chain.

### Improved Traceability

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps enable improved traceability of products as they move through the supply chain. By capturing information about each step in the process, businesses can track the origin and destination of each product, as well as any intermediate locations. This can be especially useful in the event of a product recall, as it enables businesses to quickly identify the source of the problem and take appropriate action.

### Enhanced Inventory Management

The detailed data captured in EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can also improve inventory management. By knowing exactly where each product is located in the supply chain, businesses can optimize their inventory levels and ensure that they have the right products in the right place at the right time. This can help to prevent stockouts and reduce waste.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps are a powerful tool for businesses looking to gain better visibility into their supply chain operations. By capturing granular data about each step in the process, businesses can improve traceability, enhance inventory management, and identify areas for improvement. The standardized format of the data flows in EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps also enables interoperability between different systems, making it easier for businesses to exchange information with their supply chain partners. As businesses continue to embrace the digital transformation of their supply chain operations, EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps will be a crucial component in achieving their goals.
