# What Supply Chains Can Learn from EPCIS and CBV

The global supply chain is a complex ecosystem that involves various activities, players, and technologies. It spans the entire process of sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, distributing, and delivering finished goods to end consumers. Maintaining visibility and control over the supply chain is becoming increasingly important for companies operating in various industries, especially those that deal with perishable or sensitive items.

In recent years, the development of electronic product code information services (EPCIS) and core business vocabulary (CBV) has revolutionized the supply chain industry by enabling greater transparency and efficiency. In this post, we will explore what EPCIS and CBV are, how they work, and what supply chains can learn from them.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard that defines a uniform way of sharing event data and information about products throughout the supply chain. Developed by GS1, a global organization that develops and maintains standards for various industries, EPCIS utilizes unique identifiers known as electronic product codes (EPCs) to track and trace items as they move through the supply chain.

EPCIS captures data related to various events such as the manufacture, shipment, receipt, and disposition of products. This data can be collected using various auto-ID technologies such as barcodes, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, and sensors. The collected data can then be shared in real-time with other supply chain partners and stakeholders, enabling greater visibility and control over the supply chain.

## What is CBV?

CBV is a set of standardized terms and definitions that describe various business processes and activities within the supply chain. Developed by the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), CBV provides a common language and framework for businesses to communicate with each other, regardless of their industries or geographical locations.

CBV is based on the Unified Modelling Language (UML), a widely used graphical language for modeling software systems. This makes it easy for companies to integrate CBV into their existing software systems and share information with other supply chain partners.

## How do EPCIS and CBV work together?

EPCIS and CBV work together to provide end-to-end visibility and control over the supply chain. EPCIS captures data related to various events such as the manufacture, shipment, receipt, and disposition of products, while CBV provides a common communication framework for businesses to share this data with each other.

For example, suppose a company manufactures products using various raw materials sourced from different suppliers. In that case, EPCIS can capture data related to the receipt of these raw materials, such as the date of receipt, the quantity received, and any relevant tracking information. This data can then be shared with other supply chain partners using CBV, enabling better collaboration and decision-making.

EPCIS and CBV can also be used to track and trace products as they move through the supply chain. For instance, if a company ships products to a distributor, EPCIS can capture data related to the shipment, such as the date of shipment, the carrier used, and the destination address. This data can then be shared with the distributor using CBV, enabling them to track the shipment and make any necessary arrangements for receipt.

## What Supply Chains Can Learn from EPCIS and CBV?

There are several lessons that supply chains can learn from EPCIS and CBV:

### 1. Standardization is essential

EPCIS and CBV provide a standardized approach to capturing, sharing, and communicating supply chain data. Standardization is essential to ensure that businesses can communicate with each other effectively, regardless of their industry or location. By adopting a standardized approach, supply chain partners can reduce errors and improve collaboration, leading to greater efficiency and profitability.

### 2. Real-time data is critical

In today's fast-paced business environment, real-time data is becoming increasingly important. EPCIS and CBV enable businesses to capture and share data in real-time, providing greater visibility and control over the supply chain. Real-time data enables businesses to make more informed decisions, respond quickly to changing market conditions, and optimize their operations for maximum efficiency.

### 3. Collaboration is key

EPCIS and CBV facilitate greater collaboration between supply chain partners, enabling them to work together to achieve common goals. By sharing data and information in real-time, businesses can identify and address potential issues before they become major problems. Collaboration also enables businesses to identify opportunities for improvement and innovation, leading to greater efficiency and profitability.

### 4. Technology is a game-changer

EPCIS and CBV utilize various technologies such as barcodes, RFID tags, and sensors to capture and share data. Technology is a game-changer in the supply chain industry, enabling businesses to capture and analyze data at a scale that was previously impossible. By leveraging technology, businesses can optimize their operations, reduce waste, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS and CBV are game-changing technologies that have revolutionized the supply chain industry. These technologies enable businesses to capture and share data in real-time, providing greater visibility and control over the supply chain. By adopting a standardized approach to supply chain data, businesses can reduce errors and improve collaboration, leading to greater efficiency and profitability. As the supply chain industry continues to evolve, EPCIS and CBV will undoubtedly play a critical role in its future development.
