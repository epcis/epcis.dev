# A Beginner's Guide to EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

## Introduction

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard used for exchanging information about the movement of goods throughout the supply chain. It allows partners to track and trace products in real-time, increasing visibility and reducing the need for manual intervention. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the standard, which introduces new features and improvements compared to the previous version. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps, an essential concept for understanding the standard.

## What are BizSteps?

In the EPCIS 2.0 standard, a BizStep represents a significant milestone or event in the lifecycle of a product. It is a way of describing the state or status of a product at a particular moment in time. A BizStep is associated with an object or entity, which can be a product, a shipment, or any other asset that needs to be tracked and traced.

## Why are BizSteps Important?

The use of BizSteps is crucial for establishing a common language between supply chain partners. By defining standard events and milestones, such as Shipping or Receiving, partners can easily track and share information about the state of a product. This simplifies communication and reduces the risk of errors and misunderstandings when exchanging information. Additionally, BizSteps allow for easier reporting and analytics, which can help to identify inefficiencies and optimize the supply chain.

## How are BizSteps Used in EPCIS 2.0?

In EPCIS 2.0, BizSteps are used to describe the movement and status of an object throughout the supply chain. Here are some examples of BizSteps that can be used:

- Shipping: when a product is shipped from a supplier to a retailer.
- Receiving: when a product is received by a retailer or customer.
- Quality Control: when a product is inspected and verified for quality.
- Out of Stock: when a product is no longer available for sale.
- Disposal: when a product is removed from the supply chain for any reason.

Each BizStep has a unique identifier, which is used to distinguish it from other events. Additionally, each BizStep can have associated attributes, such as location, time, and quantity. These attributes provide additional context and metadata about the event, which can be used for reporting and analysis.

## How to Implement BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0

Implementing BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 requires a structured approach, defined by the standard. Here are some steps to follow:

1. Define the BizSteps: Work with your supply chain partners to identify the key milestones and events that should be tracked. Document these events and agree on a standard naming convention for the BizSteps.
2. Map the BizSteps to Objects: Identify the objects or entities that will be associated with each BizStep. It is possible to associate multiple objects with a single BizStep, such as a product and a shipment.
3. Associate Attributes with BizSteps: Define the attributes that should be associated with each BizStep, such as location, time, and quantity. These attributes provide additional context and metadata about the event, which can be used for reporting and analysis.
4. Integrate with EPCIS: Implement the BizSteps using the EPCIS 2.0 standard. This may require developing or configuring software to capture and store the events in a standard format.

## Best Practices for Using BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0

Here are some best practices to follow when using BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0:

1. Standardize Naming Conventions: Use a standardized naming convention for your BizSteps, such as those defined in the EPCIS 2.0 standard. This simplifies communication and ensures that everyone is using the same language.
2. Define Clear Business Rules: Define clear rules for when each BizStep should be used. This reduces the risk of errors and ensures that events are recorded consistently.
3. Use Standardized Attributes: Use standardized attributes for each BizStep, as defined in the EPCIS 2.0 standard. This ensures that the attributes can be easily interpreted and analyzed.
4. Maintain Data Quality: Ensure that the data captured for each BizStep is accurate and complete. This is crucial for accurate reporting and analysis.
5. Monitor and Analyze: Monitor and analyze the data captured for each BizStep to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement in your supply chain.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, BizSteps are a vital concept for understanding the EPCIS 2.0 standard. By defining standard events and milestones, BizSteps enable partners to track and share information about the movement and status of products throughout the supply chain. Implementing BizSteps requires a structured approach, defined by the standard. To get the most out of BizSteps, it is crucial to follow best practices, such as standardizing naming conventions, defining clear business rules, and maintaining data quality. By doing so, supply chain partners can improve visibility, reduce errors and inefficiencies, and optimize the supply chain.
