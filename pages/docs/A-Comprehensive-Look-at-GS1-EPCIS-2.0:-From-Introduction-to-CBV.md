# A Comprehensive Look at GS1 EPCIS 2.0: From Introduction to CBV

If you work in the supply chain or logistics industry, you've probably heard of GS1 EPCIS 2.0. This global standard enables companies to exchange supply chain event data in a standardized way, resulting in improved supply chain visibility and collaboration across trading partners.

But what exactly is EPCIS 2.0, and how do its various components - including the Commercial Business Vocabulary (CBV) - work together to create a more efficient and transparent supply chain? In this post, we'll take a deep dive into EPCIS 2.0, exploring its origins, features, and uses.

## Introduction to GS1 EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is a framework for exchanging data related to supply chain events. It was first introduced by GS1 - an international organization that works to develop and promote standards for the supply chain - in 2007 as a response to the need for better collaboration and data exchange between trading partners.

One of the key features of EPCIS 2.0 is the use of Electronic Product Code (EPC) - a standardized code that uniquely identifies a product. By incorporating EPC into supply chain event data, EPCIS 2.0 allows for improved tracking and tracing of products throughout their lifecycle.

The standard's ability to capture and share data related to events - such as when a product is manufactured, shipped, or received - makes it a valuable tool for improving supply chain visibility, reducing inventory costs, and enhancing overall efficiency.

## The Components of EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 consists of several components that work together to enable the exchange of supply chain event data. These components include:

### 1. Event Capture

The first component of EPCIS 2.0 is event capture. This involves capturing data related to supply chain events - such as the shipment of a product from a supplier to a retailer - and saving it in a standardized format.

Event capture can be achieved through a variety of methods, including RFID, barcodes, and sensors. Once the data is captured, it can be stored in a supply chain event repository.

### 2. Event Query

The second component of EPCIS 2.0 is event query. This involves querying the supply chain event repository to retrieve specific event data.

Event query enables trading partners to access the supply chain data they need in a timely and efficient manner, improving collaboration and reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions.

### 3. Event Transportation

Event transportation refers to the process of sending and receiving supply chain event data between trading partners. EPCIS 2.0 uses a standard XML message format for event transportation, making it easy for trading partners to exchange data regardless of their existing IT systems.

### 4. Event Transformation

Event transformation involves converting supply chain event data from one format to another. EPCIS 2.0 supports the conversion of data from various sources, making it easy for trading partners to exchange data without needing to overhaul their existing IT systems.

### 5. Event Storage

Finally, event storage involves storing supply chain event data in a consistent and standardized format. By storing the data in a consistent way, trading partners can more easily retrieve and share the data they need.

## Commercial Business Vocabulary (CBV)

One of the key components of EPCIS 2.0 is the Commercial Business Vocabulary (CBV). The CBV is a standardized set of terms and definitions used to describe supply chain events.

By using the CBV to describe supply chain events, trading partners can more easily understand and interpret the data being exchanged. This improves collaboration and reduces the risk of misunderstandings or errors.

The CBV includes a variety of attributes that can be used to describe supply chain events. These attributes include:

- Business Location: the physical location where a supply chain event occurred
- Business Process Type: the type of supply chain event that occurred (e.g. shipment, receipt, production)
- Business Transaction Type: the type of transaction that occurred (e.g. purchase order, invoice)
- Company: the company that initiated the supply chain event
- Product: the product being tracked throughout the supply chain
- Quantity: the quantity of the product involved in the supply chain event
- Time: the date and time that the supply chain event occurred

By incorporating these attributes into supply chain event data, the CBV enables trading partners to more easily interpret the data being exchanged, improving collaboration and efficiency.

## Use Cases for EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 has a variety of use cases across different industries. Some of the most common use cases include:

### 1. Healthcare

In the healthcare industry, EPCIS 2.0 can be used to track the movement of medical devices and supplies throughout the supply chain. This improves inventory management and reduces the risk of medical product shortages.

### 2. Retail

In the retail industry, EPCIS 2.0 can be used to track the movement of products from the manufacturer to the retailer. This improves supply chain visibility and helps retailers better manage their inventory.

### 3. Automotive

In the automotive industry, EPCIS 2.0 can be used to track the movement of parts and supplies throughout the supply chain. This improves inventory management and reduces the risk of supply chain disruptions.

### 4. Food and Beverage

In the food and beverage industry, EPCIS 2.0 can be used to track the movement of products from the farm to the grocery store. This improves food safety and helps to reduce the risk of food recalls.

## Conclusion

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a powerful tool for improving supply chain collaboration and efficiency. Through its various components - including event capture, event query, event transportation, event transformation, and event storage - EPCIS 2.0 enables trading partners to exchange supply chain event data in a standardized way.

The Commercial Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a critical component of EPCIS 2.0, providing a standardized set of terms and definitions that facilitate the interpretation and analysis of supply chain event data.

With a variety of use cases across different industries - including healthcare, retail, automotive, and food and beverage - EPCIS 2.0 is poised to continue growing in importance as a tool for improving supply chain visibility, efficiency, and collaboration.
