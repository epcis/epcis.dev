# A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0

As technology has advanced, businesses have begun to focus increasingly on data sharing and integrity. To address this need, the GS1 organization has created EPCIS, a standard protocol for data sharing across industries. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 includes a number of key features, among them the CBV, or Core Business Vocabulary. In this guide, we will give an introduction and deep dive of the CBV and its significance in GS1 EPCIS 2.0. 

## What is the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)

At its core, the CBV is a set of standardized terms used to describe common business concepts. The goal of the CBV is to provide a common language that all EPCIS users can use to describe data. This ensures that data is consistent and easily understood across businesses, regardless of industry, location or language. 

The CBV is built on top of a wider set of global data attributes defined by GS1, including the Global Location Number (GLN) and the Global Trade Identification Number (GTIN). In practice, the CBV includes a range of terms such as event types and business classifications. 

The CBV is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Rather, it is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing individual organizations to add their own unique terms and definitions to the taxonomy. The result is a shared vocabulary that can be used by all parties involved in a supply chain to improve data sharing, reduce errors, and increase efficiency. 

## CBV Event Types 

One of the key components of the CBV is its event types. These are pre-defined, standardized descriptions of different types of supply chain events. By using event types, organizations can more easily share data with other businesses and track inventory as it moves through the supply chain. Here are some of the most commonly used event types in the CBV: 

- EPCISEventDocument: A top-level event that describes an entire EPCIS document.
- ObjectEvent: An event that describes the movement or status change of a physical object, such as a shipment of goods or product in a warehouse. 
- TransactionEvent: An event that describes a business transaction, such as a purchase, sale, or transfer of ownership.
- AssociationEvent: An event that describes a relationship between two or more objects, such as the pairing of a specific product with a specific container. 
- AggregationEvent: An event that describes the grouping of objects together, such as when multiple cases of a product are packaged together onto a pallet. 

By using these pre-defined event types in the CBV, organizations can more easily communicate the status and location of objects throughout the supply chain. This is particularly important for tracking inventory and ensuring goods are delivered on time. 

## CBV Business Classifications 

In addition to event types, the CBV also includes a range of business classifications. These are standard definitions of different types of business entities, such as manufacturers or suppliers. By using these business classifications, organizations can more easily identify and track their partners in the supply chain. Here are some of the most commonly used business classifications in the CBV: 

- BusinessLocation: A physical location where business takes place, such as a warehouse or retail store. 
- Company: A legal or commercial entity that engages in business activities, such as a corporation or a small business. 
- Party: An individual person or organization that participates in a business event, such as a shipment or order. 
- Partner: A business entity that is involved in a business transaction, such as a manufacturer or supplier. 

By using these standardized classifications, organizations can more easily identify and track their partners in the supply chain. This is particularly important for ensuring that goods are delivered on time and that all parties are aware of their responsibilities in the supply chain. 

## How CBV Fits Into GS1 EPCIS 2.0

The CBV is a key component of the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard, which provides a standardized protocol for sharing supply chain data across industries. By using the CBV, EPCIS users can more easily describe supply chain events and share data with other businesses. 

In addition to the CBV, the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard includes a range of other key features. These include the sharing of event data across different software platforms, the use of standardized data formats, and the ability to share data with external partners. 

The result is a comprehensive protocol that allows for more efficient and reliable data sharing across the supply chain. This has benefits for businesses of all sizes, from small startups to large corporations. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, the Core Business Vocabulary is a key component of the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard. By providing a shared language for describing supply chain events, the CBV makes it easier for businesses to share data and track inventory throughout the supply chain. 

As technology continues to advance, the CBV and the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard will only become more important. By embracing these standards, businesses can improve their efficiency, reduce errors, and enjoy a range of other benefits. 

Whether you are a small business owner or a large corporation, it is essential to understand the significance of the CBV in today's supply chain landscape. By using this shared vocabulary, businesses can benefit from improved data sharing and greater transparency throughout the supply chain.
