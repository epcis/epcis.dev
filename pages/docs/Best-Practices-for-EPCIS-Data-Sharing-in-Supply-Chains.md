# Best Practices for EPCIS Data Sharing in Supply Chains

Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems and technologies have improved drastically over the years, and yet, the need for better visibility and control over supply chains has remained a significant concern. EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) was developed to address the lack of visibility and traceability challenges in supply chains, providing operators with a real-time view of any transaction in the chain.

This blog post will lay out the best practices for EPCIS data sharing in supply chains to optimize the visibility and traceability of the supply chain. Whether you are a supply chain manager, logistics professional or an EPCIS data analyst, this guide will provide invaluable insights into EPCIS data sharing best practices.

Before diving into the best practices, let's first understand the concept of EPCIS.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard created by the Object Management Group (OMG) for the exchange of data from Electronic Product Code (EPC) devices within the supply chain. The standard defines a set of message formats to standardize the information exchanged, allowing interoperability between different EPCIS systems. These messages include events such as product arrival or shipment, product authenticity, and process data.

EPCIS provides a real-time view of the supply chain by capturing and sharing the individual events of products as they move through the various systems, creating an end-to-end visibility of the supply chain. EPCIS is essential to supply chain management and product traceability for many industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and luxury goods.

## Best Practices for EPCIS Data Sharing

Once you have implemented EPCIS, the best practices for EPCIS data sharing include:

### 1. Establish Data Sharing Agreements

Data sharing agreements are key to standardizing how data is collected, handled, and shared within the supply chain. It provides legal protection and ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access or manipulation. The agreement should specify the objectives of data sharing, the stakeholders involved, the data format, the data flow, and data access control.

### 2. Use Standard EPCIS Events

Using standard EPCIS events enables interoperability between the systems in the supply chain. Standardization eliminates the need for custom integration, reduces system complexity, and enables synchronization of data across the supply chain. 
Standard EPCIS events include:
* Object Event: captures events such as production, packing, shipping, and receiving.
* Aggregation Event: captures events when items are grouped for transport or inventory purposes.
* Quantity Event: captures events that change the quantity of products.
* Transaction Event: captures events that involve buying, selling, and transferring ownership or responsibility.

### 3. Implement Data Quality Controls

Data quality is crucial in ensuring the integrity and reliability of EPCIS data. Implementing data quality controls helps prevent incomplete data or data inaccuracies, which could lead to incorrect supply chain decisions. Data quality controls include data validation, data cleansing, and data auditing.

### 4. Ensure Data Security

Data security is essential to protect the privacy and integrity of EPCIS data. Data security should be established across the data exchange process, including data transmission, data reception, and data storage.

Data security measures should include:
* Access control mechanisms (authentication and authorization)
* Encryption and decryption of data
* Data backup and restoration mechanisms
* Firewall and intrusion detection systems

### 5. Ensure Scalability and Flexibility

To handle an increase in data volumes, EPCIS systems need to be scalable, meaning they can handle a growing amount of data and increase the frequency of data exchanges. 
Additionally, the EPCIS system should be flexible, allowing it to accommodate changes in the supply chain and adapt to new use cases.

### 6. Facilitate Data Access

Supply chain managers need quick access to EPCIS data to identify issues, track products, or respond to supply chain disruptions. Different stakeholders have different data needs, depending on their role, responsibilities, or geographic location.

Facilitating data access requires:
* Providing flexible data access methods to facilitate data access across different systems and devices.
* Providing data access controls to ensure that access is limited to authorized personnel only.
* Providing data visualization tools to the stakeholders, including data dashboards and data analytics tools.

### 7. Adopt Industry Standards

Industry standards such as GS1 standards are essential for achieving compliance and interoperability in the supply chain. Standards enable the EPCIS system to interface with other systems and devices, streamlining data sharing and reducing manual errors.

Adopting GS1 standards include:
* Using the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) to uniquely identify products within the supply chain.
* Using the Global Location Number (GLN) to identify locations such as warehouses, distribution centers, and manufacturers.
* Using the Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN) to ensure that the data exchanged is consistent and accurate.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, implementing EPCIS is a significant step in improving supply chain management, and ensuring visibility and traceability. However, it is not enough to only implement EPCIS; the best practices for EPCIS data sharing must also be followed to ensure maximum benefits from the technology.

Standardizing EPCIS events, establishing data sharing agreements, implementing data quality controls, ensuring data security, and adopting industry standards are all critical to effective EPCIS data sharing. EPCIS should also be scalable and flexible, allowing it to adapt to new use cases and handle an increasing amount of data. Lastly, data access should be facilitated to enable quick data access across different systems and devices.

By following the outlined best practices, supply chain professionals can leverage EPCIS to optimize their supply chains, reduce manual errors, and respond quickly to supply chain disruptions, thus saving costs and improving customer satisfaction.
