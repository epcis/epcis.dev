# The Future of GS1 CBV: Trends to Watch Out For

GS1 CBV, or Global Standards One Common Business Vocabulary, is a standardized language used by businesses to describe and exchange information about their products, services, and locations. It is the foundation for the exchange of electronic business transactions, including electronic invoicing, ordering, shipping, and payment.

In recent years, there has been a lot of buzz around the future of GS1 CBV. With advances in technology and changes in the business landscape, there are several trends to watch out for that could shape the future of this vital business tool.

## The Rise of Blockchain

Blockchain technology is becoming increasingly important in the business world. It provides a secure and transparent way of conducting transactions, making it an ideal tool for businesses that rely on exchange of information. Blockchain technology can be used to securely store and exchange GS1 CBV data, making it more efficient and secure. This is already being done in some industries, such as in the food sector to track supply chains.

In the future, we expect to see a greater use of blockchain technology in conjunction with GS1 CBV. This will make it easier for businesses to exchange information securely and confidently.

## Emphasis on Data Governance

As businesses move further into the digital age, there is a growing emphasis on data governance. This refers to the management of information assets, including GS1 CBV. As businesses become more reliant on this data to conduct transactions, it becomes imperative to ensure its accuracy, integrity, and availability. This means creating policies and procedures that govern the creation, management, and use of data.

We can expect to see a greater emphasis on data governance in relation to GS1 CBV in the coming years. This will provide greater confidence in the accuracy and reliability of this data, leading to more efficient and effective transactions.

## The Growth of Augmented Reality

Augmented reality (AR) is an exciting technology that is beginning to make its way into the business world. It involves the use of digital technology to overlay information on the real world, providing an enhanced experience for users. Businesses can use AR to provide product information and pricing details to customers, improving the customer experience and driving sales.

In the future, we expect to see greater integration of GS1 CBV data into augmented reality experiences. This will provide customers with detailed information about the products they are interested in, allowing them to make more informed decisions.

## A Focus on Sustainability

Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue for businesses. Consumers are becoming more conscious of the environmental impact of the products they buy, and are demanding greater transparency from the companies they buy from. GS1 CBV can play an important role in this by providing information about the sustainability of products.

In the coming years, we expect to see a greater emphasis on the use of GS1 CBV to provide information about sustainability. This will help businesses to meet the demands of consumers who are looking for more eco-friendly options.

## Greater Adoption of Cloud Technology

Cloud technology has been around for many years, but it is only recently that businesses have started to fully embrace it. Cloud technology allows businesses to store and access data from anywhere, providing greater flexibility and agility. It also provides enhanced security, as data is stored in secure data centers that are constantly monitored.

As businesses continue to move their operations to the cloud, we expect to see a greater adoption of GS1 CBV over this technology. This will make it easier for businesses to exchange information securely and seamlessly, regardless of their location.

## Conclusion

The future of GS1 CBV looks bright, with exciting new trends on the horizon. Blockchain, augmented reality, cloud technology, and data governance are just some of the trends that will shape the future of this vital tool.

As businesses continue to adapt to the changing business landscape, it is more important than ever to have a standardized language for the exchange of information. With GS1 CBV, businesses can be confident that they are using a well-established and reliable tool that will continue to evolve with the changing needs of the business world.
