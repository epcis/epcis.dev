# Best Practices for Implementing EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

In the realm of supply chain management, a significant effort has been dedicated towards defining a standard for data sharing between different companies and organizations. One such standard is the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0, which defines a set of interfaces, methods, and certifications to facilitate data sharing at different points in supply chain operations.

One of the key concepts in the EPCIS 2.0 standard is that of "BizSteps." In essence, each BizStep represents a significant event in the supply chain, such as when a product is produced, shipped, or received. Together, these BizSteps represent the full end-to-end process of a product from creation to consumption.

This article will delve into the best practices for implementing EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps, including considerations for selecting BizSteps, defining data structures, and leveraging EPCIS 2.0 features and interfaces.

## Selecting BizSteps

Before jumping into the implementation details, it is important to carefully consider which BizSteps to use for a particular supply chain process. The goal is to balance the granularity of data capture against the practicality of implementation.

For instance, defining a BizStep for each individual packaging unit might provide the most detail, but could mean a lot of work in terms of implementation and maintenance. Alternatively, it may be reasonable to define BizSteps for each batch or pallet of goods, especially if the downstream system can still capture the same level of detail through other means.

When selecting BizSteps, it is also important to consider the different parties that will be involved in each step of the process, and whether each party will have access to the same level of system capabilities. For example, a supplier might not be able to provide as much detail as a retailer in terms of product traceability, but this shouldn't preclude the supplier from participating in the process â€“ it just means that different BizSteps might apply to different parties in the supply chain.

Overall, the selection of BizSteps requires careful consideration of the balance between granularity, complexity, and practicality.

## Defining Data Structures

With the selection of BizSteps in mind, the next step is to define the data structures that will be captured at each step. The goal is to ensure that all parties involved in the supply chain have access to consistent and actionable data, regardless of which specific system they are using.

To ensure consistency, we recommend following a standardized data schema such as the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) or the Global Data Dictionary (GDD). These schemas define a common set of vocabulary and data structures that should be used across different implementations of EPCIS 2.0.

It is also important to consider the use of digital signatures and other security measures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data being shared. With the rise of cyberattacks and data breaches, robust security measures are critical to ensuring that the data being captured at each BizStep can be trusted.

## Leveraging EPCIS 2.0 Features and Interfaces

Once the BizSteps and data structures have been defined, it is time to consider how to leverage the features and interfaces of EPCIS 2.0 to facilitate data sharing and collaboration.

One key feature of EPCIS 2.0 is the ability to generate and consume events. These events are essentially messages sent between different systems, containing information about the specific BizStep that has taken place, as well as any associated data (e.g. product information, batch numbers, etc.).

To generate and consume events, EPCIS 2.0 provides two primary interfaces: the Query Interface and the Capture Interface. The Query Interface allows systems to search for specific events based on predefined criteria, while the Capture Interface allows systems to publish new events into the system.

It is worth noting that the Capture Interface offers several different modes of operation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the "Push" mode allows for real-time event publishing, while the "Subscription" mode provides a more asynchronous approach. Careful consideration needs to be given to which mode is appropriate for each specific use case.

Another key consideration is the use of "Aggregation Events." Aggregation events allow for the grouping of multiple individual events (e.g. at the packaging unit level) into a larger event (e.g. at the case or pallet level). This can help to reduce the overall volume of data being exchanged, while still providing sufficient detail to capture the full end-to-end process of a product.

Finally, it is worth mentioning the importance of testing and validation. Implementing EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps requires careful coordination between multiple systems and parties, and extensive testing and validation is critical to ensure data quality and system interoperability.

## Conclusion

Implementing EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can be a complex undertaking, but with careful planning and attention to detail, it is possible to achieve significant benefits in terms of improved traceability, reduced waste, and enhanced collaboration across the supply chain. Key considerations include selecting appropriate BizSteps, defining consistent data structures, and leveraging the features and interfaces of EPCIS 2.0. With the right approach, any organization can become a leader in supply chain management by implementing BizSteps in their EPCIS 2.0 strategy.
