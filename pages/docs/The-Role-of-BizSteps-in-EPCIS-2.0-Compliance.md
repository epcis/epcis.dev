# The Role of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 Compliance

If you work in the supply chain industry, you've likely heard of EPCIS 2.0. This industry-wide standard promises to unlock new levels of visibility into the supply chain, providing real-time tracking and traceability. But achieving EPCIS 2.0 compliance isn't as simple as flicking a switch. It requires a thorough understanding of the standard and the right tools to implement it. One of those tools is BizSteps.

In this blog post, we'll explore what BizSteps is, how it works, and its role in achieving EPCIS 2.0 compliance.

## What is BizSteps?

BizSteps is a cross-industry standard for tracking, reporting, and analyzing business processes. Put simply, it's a standardized way of describing the various steps and stages involved in a business process. By using BizSteps, businesses can streamline their operations and make them more efficient.

BizSteps is used in a variety of industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, and is often integrated with other industry standards like GS1 and EPCIS. When integrated with EPCIS, BizSteps provides businesses with a complete view of their operations, giving them the ability to track and trace items as they move through the supply chain.

## How does BizSteps work?

At its core, BizSteps is a collection of XML files that describe business processes. These files include information about the steps involved in a process, as well as any relevant data or metadata. This information can include dates, times, locations, and more.

To use BizSteps, businesses must first create a set of standardized processes using the BizSteps schema. Once these processes are defined, they can be used to track and report on business operations. When a business process is executed, the relevant data is recorded and stored in an EPCIS repository.

Because BizSteps and EPCIS are based on industry-wide standards, the data collected using BizSteps can be easily shared across different businesses and systems. This makes it possible to achieve end-to-end supply chain visibility, even when working with partners and suppliers in other parts of the world.

## The role of BizSteps in achieving EPCIS 2.0 compliance

EPCIS 2.0 compliance requires businesses to implement a standardized set of processes for tracking and tracing items as they move through the supply chain. By adopting the BizSteps schema, businesses can create these standardized processes and track them in real-time using EPCIS.

One of the key benefits of BizSteps is that it allows businesses to create customized processes. This means that they can track and report on specific events or milestones that are relevant to their operations. For example, a manufacturer might use BizSteps to track the assembly of a new product, while a retailer might use it to track the delivery of goods from a warehouse to a store.

By using BizSteps in conjunction with EPCIS, businesses can achieve complete supply chain visibility. They can track and trace items as they move through every stage of the supply chain, from production to delivery. This not only helps businesses improve efficiency and reduce waste but also provides them with the ability to quickly identify and resolve any issues that arise.

## Conclusion

BizSteps is an important tool for businesses looking to achieve EPCIS 2.0 compliance. By adopting the BizSteps schema, businesses can create standardized processes for tracking and reporting business operations. This provides them with real-time visibility into their operations, enabling them to quickly identify and resolve any issues.

If you're looking to achieve EPCIS 2.0 compliance, it's important to remember that it's not just a matter of implementing a new system. It requires a thorough understanding of the standard and the right tools to put it into practice. BizSteps is one of those tools, and by integrating it with EPCIS, businesses can achieve complete supply chain visibility and improve their operations in the process.
