# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV for efficient product recalls

The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) defines the Consumer-Driven Supply Chain Model as “a simplified view of the supply chain, which groups together those activities that are directly involved in fulfilling consumer demand.” The model highlights the importance of having the right products in the right place at the right time for the consumer. This is where Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) come in to play.

EPCIS 2.0 is a standard for storing and sharing information about the movement and status of products across the supply chain. It was developed by the standards organization EPCglobal, and it is designed to facilitate interoperability between different systems and to enable supply chain partners to share information in a consistent, standardized manner.

The CBV is a set of standard terms and definitions for describing the information that is stored and shared through EPCIS 2.0. It was developed by GS1, an international standards organization, and it is designed to enable supply chain partners to speak the same language when they share information about products.

Together, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV enable supply chain partners to have real-time visibility into the movement and status of products. This visibility is critical for efficient product recalls.

Product recalls are a costly and time-consuming process for all parties involved. The ability to quickly trace the origin of defective or potentially dangerous products is critical for mitigating the risk of harm to consumers and minimizing the economic impact of the recall.

Before EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, product recall investigations could take weeks or even months. Supply chain partners had to manually track down the source of the problem, which could involve reviewing paper records, contacting multiple parties, and conducting physical inspections. The lack of standardization and interoperability between systems further impeded the investigation process.

With EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, supply chain partners can quickly and easily identify the origin of a defective product. By leveraging the standards and definitions provided by the CBV, supply chain partners can share information about products in a consistent and standardized manner. This reduces the time required to interpret and reconcile different data formats.

EPCIS 2.0 provides a framework for sharing information between different systems, ensuring that all parties have access to the latest information about the movement and status of products. Supply chain partners can query the EPCIS 2.0 repository to trace the location and status of a product at any point in time. This allows for a faster and more accurate investigation process, reducing the risk of harm to consumers and minimizing the economic impact of the recall.

In addition to facilitating efficient product recalls, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provide a range of benefits to supply chain partners. These benefits include increased efficiency, enhanced visibility, improved data accuracy, and reduced operational costs.

Increased efficiency is achieved by standardizing and automating processes that were previously manual and time-consuming. Enhanced visibility is achieved by providing real-time access to information about the movement and status of products across the supply chain. Improved data accuracy is achieved by standardizing the terms and definitions used to describe products, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.

Reduced operational costs are achieved by streamlining processes and reducing the need for manual labor. The ability to quickly identify the origin of defective products reduces the need for extensive investigations and product recalls.

In conclusion, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are critical components of the Consumer-Driven Supply Chain Model. They enable supply chain partners to share information in a consistent and standardized manner, providing real-time visibility into the movement and status of products. This visibility is critical for efficient product recalls, reducing the time and cost required for investigations and minimizing the risk of harm to consumers. By leveraging the benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, supply chain partners can increase efficiency, enhance visibility, improve data accuracy, and reduce operational costs.
