# How EPCIS and CBV can deliver value in Business Transformation

Business transformation is a critical process that involves changes to an organization's operations, processes, technologies, and culture to achieve strategic goals. One of the key enablers of business transformation is the use of enterprise systems that provide end-to-end visibility, traceability, and control of business processes. In this post, we will explore how Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) can deliver value in business transformation.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is an open standard for sharing information about products, goods, and assets across the supply chain. EPCIS provides a common language and framework for capturing, exchanging, and using data throughout the product lifecycle. EPCIS enables real-time visibility into the location, status, and history of products, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and optimize their operations.

## What is CBV?

CBV is a standardized vocabulary that defines the core business concepts used in EPCIS. CBV provides a consistent set of terms and definitions that enable organizations to share data and insights across different systems and platforms. CBV helps to eliminate ambiguity and promote interoperability between different systems, making it easier to integrate data from different sources and systems.

## How EPCIS and CBV enable Business Transformation

EPCIS and CBV enable business transformation by providing end-to-end visibility, traceability, and control over business processes. EPCIS provides real-time visibility into the location, status, and history of products, enabling organizations to optimize their inventory, supply chain, and logistics operations. CBV provides a standardized vocabulary that enables organizations to share data and insights across different systems and platforms, making it easier to integrate data from different sources and systems.

Here are three ways that EPCIS and CBV can deliver value in business transformation:

### 1. Improved Traceability and Control

EPCIS and CBV enable organizations to improve traceability and control over their products and assets. By using EPCIS to track the movement of products and assets across the supply chain, organizations can identify bottlenecks, optimize their logistics operations, and reduce the risk of lost or stolen goods. CBV provides a standardized vocabulary that enables stakeholders to understand and communicate the movement and status of products and assets across different systems and platforms.

### 2. Increased Efficiency and Optimization

EPCIS and CBV enable organizational efficiency and optimization by providing real-time visibility into product movement, inventory levels, and supply chain operations. By using EPCIS to track product movement, organizations can identify opportunities to optimize their inventory and logistics operations, reduce waste and improve delivery times. CBV enables stakeholders to easily understand and communicate operational performance metrics and make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency.

### 3. Enhanced Collaboration and Innovation

EPCIS and CBV enable collaboration and innovation by providing a common language and framework for sharing data and insights across different systems and platforms. By using EPCIS and CBV, organizations can collaborate with their partners and suppliers to optimize their operations and drive innovation across the value chain. EPCIS and CBV enable data-driven decision-making, empowering stakeholders to identify opportunities for improvement and drive innovation across their organizations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS and CBV can deliver significant value in business transformation by enabling end-to-end visibility, traceability, and control over business processes. EPCIS provides real-time visibility into product movement and inventory levels, while CBV provides a standardized vocabulary that enables stakeholders to easily understand and communicate data across different systems and platforms. By using EPCIS and CBV, organizations can improve operational efficiency, increase supply chain optimization and enable collaboration and innovation across the value chain.
