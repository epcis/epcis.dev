# Simplifying Supply Chain Management with EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

The rise of global trade and e-commerce has led to an increase in the complexity of supply chain management. Supply chain management has become more challenging due to the sheer volume of transactions, the need for transparency, and the need to track goods and products throughout the entire supply chain. In this blog post, we will discuss how EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can help simplify supply chain management.

## The EPCIS 2.0 Standard

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard developed by EPCglobal to support the exchange of electronic supply chain-related information. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of this standard, which offers improved performance, scalability, and flexibility over previous versions.

The EPCIS 2.0 standard provides a framework for supply chain data sharing. It enables businesses to track, trace, and manage the movement of goods and products in real-time throughout the entire supply chain. EPCIS 2.0 uses standardized data formats, which facilitates cross-organization, cross-industry, and cross-border data sharing.

## What Are EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps?

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps are predefined events or milestones in the supply chain that are used to standardize the recording and sharing of supply chain data. BizSteps are classified into different categories, such as shipping, receiving, and quality control. BizSteps are identified by a unique code, which enables businesses to identify the specific event or milestone in supply chain transactions.

BizSteps help simplify supply chain management by providing a standardized framework for recording and sharing supply chain data. This framework enables businesses to automate supply chain processes and improve supply chain visibility. For example, businesses can use BizSteps to identify bottlenecks in the supply chain and optimize logistics or supply chain workflows accordingly.
