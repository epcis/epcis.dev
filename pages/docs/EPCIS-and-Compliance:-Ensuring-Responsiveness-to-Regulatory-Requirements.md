# EPCIS and Compliance: Ensuring Responsiveness to Regulatory Requirements

Efficient and effective supply chain management (SCM) is crucial for businesses of all sizes to maintain competitive advantage in today's global market. Supply chain visibility has had an effect on reducing supply chain costs and improved customer satisfaction. However, this increased efficiency and visibility comes with regulatory requirements, and the pressure to comply with these requirements has never been greater. This is where Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) plays a vital role.

In this post, we will explore what EPCIS is and how it helps businesses to comply with regulatory requirements by enhancing supply chain transparency.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is an open standard that enables businesses to capture and share supply chain information in a standardized format. It is designed to facilitate supply chain collaboration between trading partners and provides a common language for businesses to communicate information about products and goods as they move through the supply chain.

In simple words, EPCIS is an electronic record-keeping system that tracks products and their movements in the supply chain. It allows businesses to monitor and trace items from manufacture to delivery, providing full transparency across the supply chain.

This transparency is achieved by using standardized events and data fields that provide valuable information about products, their location, condition, and other key attributes. This data is then shared across the supply chain, giving everyone involved access to real-time data.

## Why is EPCIS important?

The importance of EPCIS is not just limited to improving supply chain visibility. Regulatory bodies across the world have recognized the role EPCIS can play in enhancing supply chain transparency, facilitating compliance, and reducing the cost of regulatory compliance.

For instance, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has mandated the use of EPCIS in pharmaceutical supply chains to track and trace drugs to ensure patient safety. The European Union's Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) also mandates the use of EPCIS for tracking and tracing of drugs.

EPCIS is also crucial for businesses that operate in highly regulated industries such as the consumer goods, food and beverage, and automotive industries. By providing complete supply chain visibility, EPCIS helps these businesses to meet regulatory requirements, protect their brand reputation, and reduce the risk of non-compliance penalties.

## How does EPCIS work?

EPCIS works by capturing and sharing supply chain events in a standardized format. These events could include product manufacturing, shipping, and delivery, and can be captured by various technologies such as barcodes, RFID tags, and sensors.

The data collected is then stored in a structured format, with standardized data fields that are easy to read and interpret by all parties involved. This ensures that everyone in the supply chain can access the same data in near real-time, enabling them to make informed decisions about the products in transit.

EPCIS also supports event-driven workflows, which means that processes and workflows can be triggered automatically based on specific events or conditions. For example, if a product is deemed to be at risk of spoilage during transit, an alert can be sent to the relevant parties to take corrective action.

## Ensuring Compliance with EPCIS

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, businesses must implement EPCIS in a way that aligns with regulatory standards and requirements.

Here are some best practices to ensure regulatory compliance when using EPCIS:

### Understand Regulatory Requirements

Businesses must have a clear understanding of the regulatory requirements relating to their products and industry. This will help them to determine which events and data fields to capture, and how to capture them.

### Implement Data Governance

Data governance is an essential component of any EPCIS implementation. It involves establishing policies and procedures for data collection, storage, sharing, and retention. This ensures that the data captured is accurate, complete, and compliant with regulatory standards.

### Train Employees

Organizations must train their employees on the proper use of EPCIS and its importance in ensuring compliance. This includes training employees on how to capture and input data into the system, as well as how to interpret the data and use it for decision-making.

### Collaborate with Trading Partners

To truly realize the benefits of EPCIS, it is important to collaborate with trading partners in the supply chain. This includes agreeing on standards for data capture and sharing, and establishing clear lines of communication for sharing information about products in transit.

### Conduct Regular Audits

Regular audits of EPCIS implementation can help businesses to identify areas of non-compliance and take corrective action. Companies should conduct internal audits regularly and also participate in external audits conducted by regulatory bodies.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS is an essential tool for businesses looking to improve supply chain transparency and comply with regulatory requirements. By capturing and sharing standardized supply chain events and data, EPCIS provides valuable information to businesses and regulatory bodies alike.

To ensure transparency and compliance, businesses must implement EPCIS in accordance with best practices and regulatory standards. This includes understanding regulatory requirements, implementing data governance, training employees, collaborating with trading partners, and conducting regular audits.

The benefits of EPCIS are clear: increased accountability, improved visibility, and reduced compliance costs. By adopting EPCIS, businesses can maintain a competitive advantage in the global marketplace and ensure that they protect their brand reputation while respecting regulatory requirements.
