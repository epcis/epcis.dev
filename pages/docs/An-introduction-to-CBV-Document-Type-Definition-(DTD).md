# An Introduction to CBV Document Type Definition (DTD)

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 is the latest version of the standard for sharing and exchanging supply chain information generated by the EPC Global community. The EPCIS 2.0 builds on the previous version to provide a more comprehensive and standardized approach to capturing, exchanging, and analyzing data across supply chains. 

One key enhancement in the EPCIS 2.0 is the introduction of the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) Document Type Definition (DTD). The CBV DTD facilitates the exchange of electronic data between diverse systems in a standardized manner. This blog post provides an introduction to the CBV DTD and its importance in supply chain management.

## What is a Document Type Definition (DTD)?

A Document Type Definition (DTD) is an XML file that defines the structure of an XML document. It defines the elements, attributes, and entities that can be used in an XML document. It provides a blueprint for documents to be validated against a schema, ensuring they contain the correct elements and are structured correctly. 

A DTD can be used to ensure that documents follow a certain structure and can be read across different systems without issues. By defining the structure of a document, systems can validate it automatically, making it easier to deal with documents that contain different types of data.

## What is Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)?

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of standard terms used to define data elements and attributes that are commonly used within a supply chain. It is an integral part of the EPCIS 2.0 standard that provides a unified vocabulary for businesses to use within their supply chains. 

The CBV provides a standardized way of defining data elements and attributes that are required for interoperable supply chain systems. The use of CBV allows for a standardized application of data attributes and elements, from both internal and external systems, enabling seamless integration of supply chain data. 

## What is the CBV DTD?

The CBV DTD is a document type definition that conforms to the CBV vocabulary. It provides a standardized way of formatting electronic documents to support interoperability between systems using the CBV. It contains definitions for CBV elements that can be used across different systems, in a standardized and uniform way. 

CBV DTD can be used to create validated documents that conform to the CBV vocabulary, which allows for the exchange of data between different systems. By using the CBV DTD, businesses can integrate supply chain data more efficiently and effectively.

## Why is the CBV DTD important in supply chain management?

The CBV DTD is important in supply chain management for several reasons:

### 1. Automated Validation of Data

One of the key benefits of using the CBV DTD is that it automates the validation of data. The use of the CBV DTD means that documents' structures are pre-defined, and any errors are detected automatically, reducing the possibility of data errors.

### 2. Standardization of Data Elements

The use of CBV DTD provides a unified vocabulary for describing data elements and attributes within a supply chain. This standardization allows businesses to use a common language and data structure, facilitating data exchange, and reducing the need for costly manual translations.

### 3. Improved Interoperability 

The use of CBV DTD promotes interoperability between multiple internal and external systems used in the supply chain. By standardizing the way data is shared between systems, organizations can reduce the risk of errors and mistakes in data transfer.

### 4. Consistent Data Handling

The use of the CBV DTD ensures that all parties involved in a supply chain are using a common format for handling data. This consistency leads to improved efficiency, accuracy, and transparency across the supply chain.

## Conclusion

CBV DTD is a crucial element of EPCIS 2.0, providing standardized documentation for the exchange of data between diverse systems in a supply chain. Its use promotes automated validation of data, standardization of data elements, and improvement of interoperability, contributing to increased data quality and efficiency. With the CBV DTD, businesses can ensure that data is shared more easily and accurately, leading to better decisions and improved supply chain performance.
