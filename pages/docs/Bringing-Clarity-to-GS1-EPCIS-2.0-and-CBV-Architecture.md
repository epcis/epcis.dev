# Bringing Clarity to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Architecture

## Introduction

The Global Standards One (GS1) Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a global standard that provides a common format for sharing data across the supply chain. The EPCIS standard defines a common language for information sharing which focuses on the tracking and tracing of products and logistics operations. This standard is designed to improve supply chain visibility, accuracy, and efficiency.

In October 2018, the GS1 EPCIS standard was updated to version 2.0. This latest version includes significant changes and improvements from the previous version (1.2). One of the most significant improvements in version 2.0 is the introduction of the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) architecture.

In this blog post, we will provide an introduction and deep dive into GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Architecture, explaining their role in supply chain management and providing insights into how organizations can use them to improve their operations.

## Understanding GS1 EPCIS 2.0

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a global standard that defines a common format for sharing data across the supply chain. The standard focuses on the tracking and tracing of products and logistics operations.

EPCIS 2.0 introduces several significant changes from the previous version. Key upgrades include:

- A new messages schema, which provides a standardized method for sharing data across different systems.
- Support for event-driven architecture, which allows businesses to receive real-time notifications when products move through the supply chain.
- A new data serialization method known as CBV, which significantly improves data interoperability between different systems.
- An improved query API that allows users to search for specific events and retrieve relevant documents.

One of the most significant changes in EPCIS 2.0 is the introduction of the Core Business Vocabulary Architecture.

## Understanding CBV Architecture

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) Architecture is a new data serialization method that has been introduced in EPCIS 2.0. CBV is designed to improve data interoperability across different systems.

CBV defines the structure for key data elements used in supply chain transactions, such as product information, location information, and packaging information. These elements are packaged together to create a standard document, which can be used by different systems to communicate and share information.

By implementing CBV, businesses can improve data quality and reduce data entry errors. CBV also makes it easier for businesses to share data with external partners or systems, improving supply chain visibility and efficiency.

CBV is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). RDF defines a standard method for expressing metadata and has been widely adopted as a way to semantically describe data.

CBV includes a set of ontology files that define the structure and relationships of key data elements used in EPCIS transactions. These files provide a framework for creating consistent, reusable data models that improve data quality and interoperability.

## Benefits of Using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Architecture

The adoption of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Architecture can significantly improve supply chain management across different industries. Some of the key benefits of using these standards include:

### Improved Visibility

EPCIS 2.0 provides real-time updates on product movements, enabling businesses to track and trace products across the supply chain. This level of visibility can help businesses identify issues and optimize their operations in real-time.

CBV also improves visibility by providing a common language for data sharing between different systems. This ensures that all parties have access to the same information, reducing the risk of errors and delays.

### Improved Efficiency

By improving visibility and reducing errors, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can increase supply chain efficiency. This can lead to reduced lead times, better forecasting, and lower costs.

### Improved Accuracy

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV improve data accuracy by providing a standardized method for data sharing. This eliminates the need for manual data entry, minimizing the risk of errors and reducing the time required for data reconciliation.

### Improved Interoperability

CBV provides a common language for data sharing between different systems, improving interoperability. This makes it easier for businesses to work with external partners and systems, creating a more seamless and integrated supply chain.

### Improved Security

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide a secure way to share data across the supply chain. Using these standards can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Implementing GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Architecture

To implement EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Architecture, businesses need to follow a structured approach. The following steps can help organizations effectively implement these standards:

### 1. Define Use Cases

The first step in implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is to define use cases. This involves identifying the specific business problems or scenarios that these standards will be used to address.

Use cases may include tracking and tracing products, improving supply chain visibility, reducing lead times, or improving data quality. By defining use cases, businesses can ensure that they are implementing these standards in a way that aligns with their strategic goals.

### 2. Identify Data Elements

The next step is to identify the key data elements that will be used in supply chain transactions. This includes product information, location information, and packaging information.

Using the CBV ontology files, businesses can define the structure and relationships of these data elements. This ensures that all parties have access to the same information, reducing the risk of errors and delays.

### 3. Implement EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

The next step is to implement EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. This involves integrating these standards into existing systems and processes.

Businesses can use the EPCIS 2.0 messages schema to facilitate data sharing between different systems. This can be done through an enterprise service bus, API gateway, or other integration methods.

CBV can be implemented using existing data serialization methods, such as XML or JSON. Using CBV, businesses can create reusable, semantically defined data models that improve data quality and interoperability.

### 4. Test and Validate

The final step is to test and validate the implementation of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. This involves testing the interoperability of different systems and validating the accuracy and consistency of data.

Testing and validation may involve creating test cases, executing test scripts, and verifying the results. This ensures that the implementation of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV meets the requirements defined in the use cases.

## Conclusion

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Architecture are essential tools for supply chain management. These standards provide a common language for data sharing, enabling businesses to improve visibility, efficiency, accuracy, interoperability, and security.

Implementing EPCIS 2.0 and CBV requires a structured approach, including defining use cases, identifying data elements, integrating these standards into existing systems, and testing and validating the implementation.

By following these steps, businesses can effectively implement EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, improving their operations and creating a more seamless and integrated supply chain.
