# How CBV Can Help Your Business Meet Sustainability Goals

In today's world, businesses are taking a more active role in addressing sustainability issues. Sustainable practices are no longer an option but a necessity for businesses that want to thrive in the long run. One way businesses can achieve sustainability is by implementing the Carrier-Branded Volume (CBV) program. In this blog post, we will explore what CBV is and how it can help businesses meet their sustainability goals.

## What is CBV?

Carrier-branded volume (CBV) is a program implemented by carriers to incentivize businesses to be more sustainable. The program offers discounts to shippers who bundle their shipments with a specific carrier. This program helps carriers increase their volume and decrease their costs, while shippers enjoy a reduced shipping cost. CBV is a win-win for both carriers and shippers, but it is more than just cost savings. It is an initiative that can help businesses meet their sustainability goals.

## How Does CBV Help in Achieving Sustainability?

### Reduce Carbon Footprint

One of the primary ways CBV can help businesses meet their sustainability goals is by reducing their carbon footprint. Shipping is one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. By using CBV, businesses can reduce their carbon footprint by consolidating shipments and reducing the number of trucks on the road. This, in turn, reduces emissions and minimizes the impact on the environment.

### Emphasize Lean Logistics

CBV also emphasizes lean logistics practices. By consolidating shipments and reducing the number of trucks on the road, CBV encourages businesses to optimize their logistics operations. This includes reducing excess inventory, improving order management processes, and using technology to track shipments. This leads to a more efficient and lean operation, which can result in cost savings for businesses.

### Encourage Sustainable Practices

CBV also encourages sustainable practices by incentivizing shippers to use more eco-friendly modes of transportation. The program offers greater discounts for shipments that use eco-friendly modes of transportation such as rail or sea transport. By doing so, shippers are encouraged to choose more sustainable options, which ultimately helps them meet their sustainability goals.

### Collaboration for Greater Sustainability

Finally, CBV encourages collaboration between carriers and shippers. Carriers and shippers work together to achieve sustainability goals by sharing information and expertise. This includes sharing data on volume and transportation routes, as well as best practices for sustainability. The program facilitates greater communication and collaboration, which ultimately leads to a greater sustainability impact.

## How to Implement CBV

Implementing CBV requires a few steps. First, the shipper must work with the carrier to identify the CBV program that best suits their needs. They must understand the terms and conditions and ensure they are willing to commit to the program. Once the shipper has agreed to participate, they must begin consolidating their shipments and using more eco-friendly modes of transportation. This may require changes to their logistics operations, including using technology to track shipments and optimize routes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, CBV is an initiative that can help businesses meet their sustainability goals. By reducing the number of trucks on the road, optimizing logistics operations, and choosing more eco-friendly modes of transportation, businesses can reduce their carbon footprint and achieve greater sustainability. Additionally, CBV encourages collaboration between carriers and shippers, which ultimately leads to greater sustainability impact.
