# Applying EPCIS to Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief

The world is currently facing various humanitarian crises and natural disasters, and the number of people affected is rising. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) reported that the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance increased from 63 million in 2018 to 168 million in 2020. In times of crisis, coordination and information sharing are crucial to delivering effective humanitarian aid and relief. 

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard developed by GS1 that provides a framework for sharing visibility information about the movement and status of goods and assets. EPCIS has been widely adopted in the retail and manufacturing industries as a means of achieving end-to-end supply chain visibility. In this blog post, we will explore how EPCIS can be applied to the humanitarian aid and disaster relief sector to improve the efficiencies and effectiveness of aid delivery.

## EPCIS in Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief

Humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations involve complex logistics, coordination between multiple stakeholders, and large volumes of goods and supplies being moved across different locations. EPCIS can provide a shared platform for real-time tracking and monitoring of relief items, including food, water, medicine, and shelter supplies. The ability to track these items through the entire supply chain, from manufacturer to recipient, enhances transparency, accountability, and efficiency.

### Real-time tracking for improved visibility

EPCIS can provide real-time tracking of aid supplies, providing transparency from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Using data capture technologies such as barcodes, RFID tags, and GPS tracking, the location and status of relief items can be monitored in real-time. This information can be shared among all stakeholders, including donors, aid agencies, and recipients, to enhance visibility and accountability. 

Real-time tracking can also enable the rapid identification of bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions, enabling quick resolutions to be implemented. For example, if relief supplies in a certain area are running low, donors can be notified, and additional supplies can be sent without delay.

### Improved coordination between stakeholders

In humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations, multiple stakeholders are involved, including donors, aid agencies, governments, and logistics providers. EPCIS can facilitate the coordination between these stakeholders, enabling real-time information sharing, and enhancing collaboration. This can result in the effective and efficient deployment of resources and aid supplies, and can help prevent duplication of efforts.

For example, if one area has received more relief supplies than necessary, these can be redirected to other areas in need. EPCIS can also help minimize the risk of fraud and corruption in aid delivery by providing transparent data on the movement of goods and supplies.

### Enhanced data analytics

EPCIS can enable the collection and analysis of data related to relief item movement, including supply chain performance and demand patterns. This data can be used to optimize the allocation of resources, monitor the effectiveness of aid delivery, and improve the planning of relief operations. Using this data, it is possible to identify trends, predict demand, and improve supply chain efficiency.

### Case Study: EPCIS used in Typhoon Haiyan Response

In 2013, the Philippines was hit by Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most devastating storms in recent history. The typhoon caused widespread damage and displacement, affecting over 14 million people. To support relief efforts, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and OCHA implemented a supply chain solution using EPCIS to track the movement of food supplies.

Using barcodes and RFID tags, the WFP was able to track the movement of food supplies to recipients in real-time, improving the visibility and accountability of the relief efforts. The EPCIS solution enabled the WFP to monitor the quantity and quality of the supplies, ensuring that aid reached those most in need. The data collected through EPCIS was analyzed to optimize the allocation of resources and improve the effectiveness of the relief efforts.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS can provide an effective framework for tracking and monitoring relief supplies in humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations. Real-time tracking, improved coordination between stakeholders, and enhanced data analytics can result in improved transparency, accountability, and efficiency in aid delivery. EPCIS has already been successfully implemented in relief efforts, such as in the response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. By adopting EPCIS in humanitarian aid and disaster relief, we can improve the effectiveness of aid delivery and help alleviate the suffering of those most in need.
