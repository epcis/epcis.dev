# Leveraging EPCIS and CBV to Improve Food Safety

Food safety is an essential aspect of the food industry, and the responsibility of ensuring it falls on everyone involved in the food supply chain. From producers to packaging facilities, distributors, and retailers, everyone has a role to play in ensuring that the food that reaches consumers is safe for consumption.

The traditional approach to food safety involves, among other things, the use of barcodes and other identification systems to track products as they move through the supply chain. However, with the emergence of new technologies, including EPCIS and CBV, there is an opportunity to improve the safety and traceability of food products further.

In this blog post, we will take a deep dive into EPCIS and CBV, examining how they work and how they can be used to improve food safety.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is an electronic standard developed by GS1 (a global standards organization) for sharing information about the movement of products and assets. Essentially, it is a way to exchange data between different stakeholders in the supply chain, such as manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.

The EPCIS standard is designed to ensure that data is shared in a standardized format, making it easy for organizations to process the information and use it for various purposes, including supply chain optimization, inventory management, and product recall management.

EPCIS works by assigning a unique identifier (a code) to each product and tracking its movement through the supply chain using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) or other tracking technologies. As the product moves from one location to another, data is captured about its location, status, and any relevant events (e.g., when it was packaged or shipped).

This data is then shared with other parties in the supply chain using EPCIS, allowing everyone involved to have real-time visibility into the location and status of products. This helps to streamline supply chain operations, reduce errors and delays, and improve overall efficiency.

## What is CBV?

CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a standard developed by GS1 to define a common language for describing the characteristics of products and assets. Essentially, it is a way to provide a common set of terms and definitions to help organizations communicate effectively about products and assets.

CBV is designed to work in conjunction with EPCIS, allowing organizations to describe the attributes of products (e.g., its weight, dimensions, and packaging) in a standardized format. This information can be used for various purposes, including inventory management, product recall management, and product information management.

Like EPCIS, CBV is designed to ensure that data is shared in a standardized format, making it easy for organizations to process the information and use it for various purposes. This helps to improve the accuracy of data and reduces errors and inconsistencies.

## How Can EPCIS and CBV Improve Food Safety?

When it comes to food safety, EPCIS and CBV can play a significant role in improving traceability and ensuring that products are safe for consumption. Here are some of the ways that these standards can be used to improve food safety:

### 1. Improving Visibility

One of the most significant benefits of EPCIS is that it provides real-time visibility into the movement of products through the supply chain. This means that if there is a problem with a particular product (e.g., contamination), it can be identified and traced back to its source quickly.

By providing end-to-end visibility into the movement of products through the supply chain, EPCIS can help to improve the speed and accuracy of product recall management. This is crucial when it comes to food safety, as the quick identification and removal of contaminated products can help prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses.

### 2. Streamlining Supply Chain Operations

Another benefit of EPCIS is that it can help to streamline supply chain operations. By providing real-time visibility into the movement of products and assets, organizations can optimize their inventory management, reduce errors and delays, and improve overall efficiency.

This can help to reduce the risk of contaminated products entering the supply chain, as well as improve the traceability and tracking of products once they enter the supply chain.

### 3. Enhancing Product Information Management

CBV can help to enhance product information management by providing a common language for describing the characteristics of products and assets. This means that everyone involved in the supply chain can communicate effectively about products, reducing errors and misunderstandings.

This is essential when it comes to food safety, as accurate product information can help to prevent contamination and other safety issues. For example, by accurately describing the packaging and storage requirements of a particular product, organizations can ensure that it is stored appropriately, reducing the risk of contamination.

### 4. Improving Recall Management

Finally, EPCIS and CBV can help to improve product recall management. By providing real-time visibility into the movement of products and a common language for describing the characteristics of products, organizations can quickly and accurately identify and recall contaminated products.

This can help to reduce the risk of contaminated products entering the supply chain and ensure that consumers are provided with accurate and timely information about product recalls.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS and CBV are two powerful standards that can be used to improve food safety in the food industry. By providing real-time visibility into the movement of products, a common language for describing the characteristics of products, and enhancing supply chain operations, these standards can help to prevent contamination and other safety issues.

As the food industry continues to evolve, it is essential that organizations leverage these standards to improve the safety and traceability of the products they produce and distribute. By doing so, they can help to ensure that consumers have access to safe, high-quality food products.
