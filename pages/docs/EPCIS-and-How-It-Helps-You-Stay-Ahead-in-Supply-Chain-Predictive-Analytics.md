# EPCIS and How It Helps You Stay Ahead in Supply Chain Predictive Analytics

As supply chains become more complex and globalized, it becomes increasingly important to have visibility and traceability across the entire supply chain. The EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) standard provides a framework for capturing and sharing critical supply chain data in real-time. In this blog post, we will explore what EPCIS is and how it can help you stay ahead of the game in supply chain predictive analytics.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is an open global standard developed by GS1, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the design and implementation of global supply chain standards. EPCIS enables the sharing of supply chain event data in a standardized format, creating a common language for businesses to communicate and collaborate on their supply chain operations.

At its core, EPCIS provides the ability to capture and share information about who, what, when, where, why, and how across the supply chain. This includes data on product movement, location, and status updates, as well as information on the parties involved in the supply chain, such as vendors, manufacturers, and distributors.

## How EPCIS Helps You Stay Ahead in Supply Chain Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. In supply chain management, predictive analytics can be used to forecast demand, optimize inventory levels, and predict delivery times.

EPCIS provides a wealth of real-time data that can be leveraged for predictive analytics. By capturing and sharing information about product movement, location, and status updates, businesses can gain valuable insights into their supply chain operations. For example, EPCIS can provide data on which products are selling more quickly, where delays are occurring in the supply chain, and how long it takes products to move through certain stages of the supply chain.

By utilizing this data, businesses can optimize their supply chain operations, improve inventory management, and ultimately improve their bottom line. For example, a clothing retailer could use EPCIS data to predict which styles and sizes will be in demand in the coming months, allowing them to purchase inventory accordingly and avoid stock shortages.

## EPCIS Use Cases

EPCIS can be used in a variety of industries and applications. Here are a few examples:

### Healthcare

EPCIS can be used in healthcare to track the movement of drugs and medical devices through the supply chain. By capturing data on when and where products are manufactured, shipped, and received, healthcare providers can ensure the safety and effectiveness of their products.

### Retail

In the retail industry, EPCIS can be used to track inventory levels and monitor product movement across the supply chain. This can help retailers optimize their stock levels and avoid stock outages, as well as provide better visibility into product demand.

### Manufacturing

EPCIS can be used in manufacturing to track the movement of raw materials and finished goods. This can help manufacturers optimize their production processes and reduce waste.

## EPCIS Implementation

Implementing EPCIS requires a robust IT infrastructure and standardized data collection processes across the supply chain. Businesses looking to implement EPCIS should work with a trusted technology partner to ensure that their data collection and sharing processes are aligned with the EPCIS standard.

## Conclusion

EPCIS is a powerful tool that can help businesses gain valuable insights into their supply chain operations, providing the foundation for predictive analytics and improved decision-making. By utilizing EPCIS data, businesses can optimize their supply chain operations, improve inventory management, and ultimately improve their bottom line. As supply chains become more complex and globalized, EPCIS will become an increasingly important standard in the world of supply chain management.
