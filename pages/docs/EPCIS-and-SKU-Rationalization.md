# EPCIS and SKU Rationalization: Understanding the Link and the Impact

As supply chains continue to grow in complexity and expand across regions and sectors, the importance of data standardization and sharing becomes paramount. That's where EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) comes in. EPCIS is a global standard for collecting, sharing, and accessing real-time data about products and their movements across supply chains. EPCIS allows all stakeholders in the supply chain - manufacturers, retailers, logistics providers, regulators, and consumers - to access the same information about products, their origin, and movements, thereby enabling real-time visibility, traceability, and efficiency. 
To implement EPCIS effectively, however, one critical prerequisite is SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) rationalization. SKU rationalization refers to the process of reducing the number of SKUs within a product line or portfolio, focusing on those that are profitable or strategic, and eliminating the rest. SKU rationalization is critical because it helps to streamline product portfolios, reduce costs, and improve supply chain efficiency. In this post, we explore the link between EPCIS and SKU rationalization, the benefits of SKU rationalization, and useful strategies and tools for achieving SKU rationalization.

## The Link Between EPCIS and SKU Rationalization

EPCIS and SKU rationalization are linked in many ways. First, EPCIS enables real-time, accurate data sharing and visibility across supply chains, giving companies the ability to identify slow-moving, low-value, or redundant SKUs quickly. For example, a retailer using EPCIS can track the sales of every SKU in their store and compare it with the sales of similar SKUs across other stores, regions, or suppliers. This data can help the retailer identify low-performing SKUs, overstocked SKUs, or SKUs that don't align with their strategic objectives. Using this data, the retailer can make informed decisions on which SKUs to keep, which to reduce, and which to eliminate.

Second, EPCIS has the potential to reduce the number of SKUs directly. By increasing the visibility and traceability of products across supply chains, EPCIS enables companies to identify commonalities and overlaps between SKUs and products. For example, a manufacturer using EPCIS can track the movements of all products that contain a particular component or ingredient, regardless of the final product they end up in. This data can help the manufacturer identify which products share the same attributes or functions and group them into families or categories. By doing so, the manufacturer can reduce the number of SKUs they need to manage without sacrificing product diversity or customer needs.

Third, EPCIS and SKU rationalization can reinforce each other's impact on supply chain efficiency and profitability. SKU rationalization can reduce costs, improve inventory turnover, and increase product availability, all of which can strengthen the business case for EPCIS. Conversely, EPCIS can provide the data and insights needed to implement SKU rationalization effectively, leading to better cost savings, revenue generation, and customer satisfaction.

## The Benefits of SKU Rationalization

The benefits of SKU rationalization are numerous and significant for all supply chain stakeholders. For manufacturers, SKU rationalization can help to:

-      Increase production efficiency and capacity by reducing the number of raw materials, components, and finished goods that need to be tracked, stored, and managed
-      Improve supply chain agility and responsiveness by focusing on SKUs that are in high demand, have short lead times, or are strategic for a particular market or geography.
-      Enhance profitability and innovation by investing resources in high-value SKUs that generate the most revenue, have the highest margins, or have growth potential.

For retailers, SKU rationalization can help to:
 
-      Reduce inventory carrying costs, excess stock, and stock-outs by optimizing the product mix and aligning inventory levels with consumer demand
-      Increase product availability and customer satisfaction by focusing on SKUs that meet consumer needs and preferences, are consistently available in store or online, and are easy to find and compare with other products
-      Improve store and shelf space utilization by removing SKUs that are slow-moving, expired, or low performing, thereby freeing up space for new, innovative, or profitable products.

For logistics providers, SKU rationalization can help to:
 
-      Streamline transportation routes, warehouse layouts, and order processing by reducing the number of unique SKUs that need to be transported, stored, and handled
-      Optimize supply chain capacity and reduce costs by consolidating and standardizing packaging, documentation, and labeling.
-      Improve supply chain visibility and traceability by tracking fewer but more strategic SKUs, thereby reducing the risk of errors, delays, or product losses.

For regulators and consumers, SKU rationalization can help to:
 
-      Increase product safety and quality by reducing the number of SKUs that need to be tested, inspected, and monitored for compliance with regulations or standards
-      Improve environmental and social impact by focusing on SKUs that are sustainable, ethical, or responsible, and phasing out those that are not.
 
## Strategies and Tools for Achieving SKU Rationalization

To achieve SKU rationalization, companies can adopt a variety of strategies and tools that work best for their specific industry, market, and business model. Some common strategies and tools for achieving SKU rationalization include:

1. Conduct a thorough SKU analysis: Before making any SKU rationalization decisions, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the product portfolio, consumer demand, and supply chain operations. Companies can use various data sources and analysis tools, such as EPCIS, sales data, market research, and product lifecycle assessments, to identify SKUs that are overstocked, slow-moving, or not profitable.

2. Prioritize SKUs based on strategic objectives: Companies should evaluate SKUs based on their strategic importance, such as revenue potential, profit margin, market share, or customer satisfaction. SKUs that align with strategic objectives should be prioritized for retention, investment, or expansion, while those that do not should be considered for removal or reduction.

3. Consolidate SKUs into families or categories: Companies can group SKUs into families or categories based on shared attributes or functions, such as product size, color, shape, or usage. Consolidating SKUs can simplify product portfolios, reduce inventory complexity, and improve supply chain efficiency.

4. Optimize product mix and packaging: Companies can optimize product mix and packaging by focusing on SKUs that are aligned with consumer preferences, market trends, or seasonal demand. Packaging can also be optimized by standardizing sizes, materials, and design, which can reduce transportation costs and environmental impact.

5. Collaborate with supply chain partners: SKU rationalization can be more effective when done collaboratively with supply chain partners, such as suppliers, retailers, or logistics providers. Collaboration can help to align product portfolios, reduce duplication of efforts, and improve data sharing and visibility across the supply chain.

## Conclusion
 
In conclusion, EPCIS and SKU Rationalization are inextricably linked, with the former providing the data insights and the latter providing the approach for efficient data management in complex supply chains. SKU rationalization provides various benefits, including cost savings, capacity optimization, supply chain agility, and innovation, and these benefits further reinforce the impact of EPCIS. Strategies and tools such as conducting thorough SKU analysis, prioritizing SKUs, consolidating SKUs into families, optimizing product mix and packaging, and collaborating with supply chain partners can all help companies achieve SKU rationalization to improve their bottom line. Companies that prioritize SKU rationalization and EPCIS would have a competitive edge in supply chain efficiencies, and also improve customer satisfaction by enhancing product availability and variability.
