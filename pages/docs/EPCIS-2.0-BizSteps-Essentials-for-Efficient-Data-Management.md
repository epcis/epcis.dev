# EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps Essentials for Efficient Data Management

In today's world, businesses generate and consume vast amounts of data on a daily basis. To ensure the efficient management of this data, it becomes critical for businesses to have a reliable data management system in place. This is where the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) comes in, which helps organizations to capture, track and trace information about products as they move through the supply chain.

The EPCIS standard provides an industrial framework for the automated exchange of information about the movement and status of goods between businesses. EPCIS allows businesses to track supply chain events through the use of standardized transactions and data structures, which can be shared between multiple systems securely. In addition, EPCIS allows for real-time tracking of supply chain events, giving businesses greater visibility and control over their supply chain operations.

In this blog post, we will explore the essential features of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, which help businesses to efficiently manage their supply chain data.

## What is EPCIS?

Before we dive into the essential features of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, let's first understand what EPCIS is all about.

EPCIS is an industrial standard for tracking and tracing products as they move through the supply chain. This standard enables businesses to capture, share, and understand the movement and status of products in a standardized way. With EPCIS, businesses can track their products from the point of manufacture to the point of sale, gaining visibility and control over every step in the supply chain.

The standard enables businesses to record all events relevant to the products they are tracking. An event is any occurrence that affects the state of a product in the supply chain. For example, an event might be the receipt of a product by the manufacturer, its movement from one location to another, or its sale to a customer. Each event is recorded along with relevant attributes such as the time and location of the event.

## Introduction to BizSteps

While EPCIS provides a standard way to exchange information about products, BizSteps provides a framework to structure supply chain events. BizSteps are predefined event types that are used to capture supply chain events in a standardized way. These event types are defined in a hierarchical structure, which ensures that event type relationships are maintained.

In EPCIS 2.0, BizSteps have been upgraded and improved to better support supply chain data management. The new features and capabilities of BizSteps provide businesses with a better understanding of their supply chain events and help them to make more informed decisions about their supply chain operations.

# Essential Features of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0

Now that we have a better understanding of EPCIS and BizSteps let's dive into the essential features of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0.

## 1. Hierarchical Structure

The hierarchical structure of BizSteps provides a standard way to capture supply chain events. The hierarchical structure ensures that event relationships are maintained and that events are captured in a logical and structured manner. This structure enables businesses to better understand their supply chain events, and to easily identify relationships between different events.

The hierarchical structure of BizSteps also enables businesses to capture events at different levels of granularity. This functionality provides businesses with the flexibility to track and trace products in a way that best suits their individual needs.

## 2. Flexibility

BizSteps is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of individual businesses. Businesses can define their own unique event types within the standard framework provided by BizSteps. This flexibility allows businesses to capture supply chain events in a way that is meaningful to them, and that provides the greatest benefit to their operations.

## 3. Standardization

Despite its flexibility, BizSteps is firmly rooted in standardization. The use of standard event types ensures that the information captured about supply chain events is consistent and meaningful. This information can be shared between different systems in a standardized way, enabling businesses to gain a greater understanding of their supply chain operations.

The use of standardization also facilitates the integration of supply chain data with other business systems. This integration can provide businesses with a more holistic understanding of their operations, which can lead to improved decision-making and increased efficiency.

## 4. Improved Event Modeling

EPCIS 2.0 improves upon the event modeling capabilities of BizSteps. This improvement enables businesses to capture more granular details about supply chain events, including event triggers and consequences.

The improved event modeling also enables businesses to capture a wider range of event types. For example, EPCIS 2.0 introduces new event types for product recalls and inventory adjustments. These event types provide businesses with a more complete understanding of their supply chain events, which can lead to improved decision-making and increased efficiency.

## 5. Better Visibility

EPCIS 2.0 provides businesses with better visibility into their supply chain operations. The hierarchical structure of BizSteps enables businesses to easily identify event relationships and to better understand the flow of products through the supply chain. This increased visibility can lead to improved decision-making and increased efficiency.

EPCIS 2.0 also provides businesses with real-time tracking capabilities. This feature enables businesses to track the movement and status of products in real-time, giving them greater control over their supply chain operations.

## Conclusion

Effective supply chain management is critical to the success of modern businesses. To ensure that supply chain data is managed efficiently, businesses need a reliable data management system in place.

EPCIS 2.0 with its upgraded and improved BizSteps provide businesses with a standardized way to capture, track and trace information about products as they move through the supply chain. The hierarchical structure of BizSteps provides businesses with better visibility into their supply chain operations and allows for real-time tracking of supply chain events. With EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps, businesses gain greater control over their supply chain operations, enabling them to make more informed decisions and operate more efficiently.
