# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV for Optimized Supply Chain Decision Making

The primary goal of any supply chain is to ensure that products arrive at their intended destinations in a timely manner and are of the highest quality possible. However, as supply chains have become more globalized and complex, this goal has become more difficult to achieve. One solution to this problem has been the development of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV (Core Business Vocabulary). This combination provides supply chain managers with the tools they need to optimize their operations and make better decisions.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) 2.0 is an extension of the original EPCIS standard. EPCIS provides a standardized way to share information about the movement and status of goods in a supply chain. This allows different organizations within the supply chain to share data more easily and collaborate more effectively. EPCIS 2.0 takes this concept one step further by adding support for more complex supply chain processes, such as reverse logistics and product recalls.

EPCIS 2.0 accomplishes this by introducing new data structures and event types. For example, EPCIS 2.0 includes a new event type called "Transformation Event" which can be used to track when a product is transformed into a new product or is combined with other products to form a new entity. This is useful for supply chains that involve complex manufacturing or processing operations.

## What is the CBV?

The CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a set of standardized terms and definitions that are commonly used in supply chain management. The CBV is designed to help companies share data more easily by providing a common vocabulary that everyone can understand.

The CBV includes terms for different types of products, such as "Batch," "Lot," and "Serialized." It also includes terms for different types of locations, such as "Facility" and "Dock Door." The CBV is constantly evolving and being updated to reflect changes in the supply chain industry.

## Benefits of Using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

There are several benefits to using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV for supply chain management. Here are a few key advantages:

### Improved Data Sharing

One of the biggest advantages of using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is improved data sharing. By standardizing the way data is exchanged between different organizations in the supply chain, companies can reduce the risk of errors and minimize the amount of time it takes to process data. This can lead to faster and more accurate decision making.

### Better Visibility

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provide supply chain managers with better visibility into the movement and status of goods throughout the supply chain. This allows managers to identify potential bottlenecks or areas where the supply chain can be optimized. For example, if a certain location in the supply chain is causing delays, managers can use EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV to identify the problem and take action to address it.

### Improved Data Quality

Another advantage of using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is improved data quality. By standardizing the way data is collected and stored, companies can reduce the risk of errors and ensure that the data they are using is accurate and up-to-date. This can help companies make better decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

### Enhanced Collaboration

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV also promote better collaboration between different organizations in the supply chain. By providing a common vocabulary and standardized data structures, companies can work together more effectively and share information more easily. This can lead to faster problem resolution and better overall performance.

## Case Study: Using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV in the Automotive Industry

One industry that has seen significant benefits from using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is the automotive industry. In 2018, the Odette International organization, which represents the European automotive industry, published a set of guidelines for implementing EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV in the industry.

The guidelines recommended using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV to track the movement of parts and finished products throughout the supply chain. By doing this, companies could improve the accuracy and speed of their supply chain processes.

One example of a company that has successfully implemented EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV in the automotive industry is Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. The company has developed a system called Alliance Cockpit, which uses EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV to track the movement of vehicles and parts throughout its global supply chain. The system provides real-time visibility into the supply chain and allows managers to identify potential issues and take corrective action quickly.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provide supply chain managers with the tools they need to optimize their operations and make better decisions. By standardizing the way data is exchanged and providing a common vocabulary, companies can improve data sharing, visibility, data quality, and collaboration. The automotive industry has been an early adopter of this technology, and other industries are sure to follow in the coming years. As supply chains become more complex and globalized, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV will play an increasingly important role in helping companies deliver high-quality products to their customers.
