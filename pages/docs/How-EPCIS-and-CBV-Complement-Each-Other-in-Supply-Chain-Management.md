# How EPCIS and CBV Complement Each Other in Supply Chain Management

As supply chains become increasingly complex and global, there is a growing need for standardized systems that enable the efficient exchange of data and information between different parties. EPCIS and CBV are two such systems that are widely used in supply chain management to enable the transparent tracking and tracing of products from the point of origin to the point of consumption. In this post, we will explore how EPCIS and CBV complement each other and how they are used in conjunction to create an efficient and effective supply chain management system.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is an open standard for capturing and sharing information about the movement and status of goods within and between organizations. It is designed to enable real-time, accurate visibility into the flow of goods across the supply chain, from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption.

EPCIS accomplishes this by providing a standardized format for capturing and sharing information about RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and other sensor-enabled shipments. RFID tags are attached to each individual product as it moves through the supply chain, and data is captured automatically as the tags are read by RFID readers at various points in the supply chain.

The data captured by EPCIS includes information about the product, such as the manufacturer, the date of production, and the expiration date, as well as information about the status of the shipment, such as its current location, handling instructions, and expected delivery time.

## What is CBV?

CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a set of common business terms and definitions that are used to describe products and services throughout the supply chain. It is designed to provide a common language for describing goods and services, which can be used by all parties involved in the supply chain to enable seamless data exchange and collaboration.

CBV accomplishes this by providing a standardized set of data elements that describe the characteristics of products and services. These data elements include information about the product's name, size, weight, color, and other attributes that are relevant to the product's identification and description.

CBV is particularly useful in supply chain management because it provides a way to standardize the language used to describe products and services across different organizations and systems. This makes it easier for different parties to exchange and use information about products and services in a consistent and meaningful way.

## How EPCIS and CBV Complement Each Other

EPCIS and CBV are designed to work together to enable seamless data exchange and collaboration throughout the supply chain. EPCIS provides a standardized format for capturing and sharing information about the movement and status of goods, while CBV provides a common language for describing products and services.

The two systems complement each other in several key ways.

### Standardization

One of the most important ways that EPCIS and CBV complement each other is through standardization. By providing standardized formats for capturing and sharing data, these two systems make it easier for different parties to work together and exchange information seamlessly.

Because EPCIS and CBV use common data formats and terminologies, organizations can share information about products and shipments without having to spend time and resources translating or reformatting the data. This improves efficiency and reduces errors, which leads to a more effective supply chain management system overall.

### Data Accuracy

Another way that EPCIS and CBV complement each other is by improving the accuracy of data throughout the supply chain. EPCIS captures data in real time as products move through the supply chain, which means that the data is always up to date and accurate.

CBV provides a common language for describing products and services, which reduces errors and inconsistencies in the data. When everyone in the supply chain uses the same terminology to describe products and services, it is easier to identify and resolve discrepancies and errors.

### Transparency

Finally, EPCIS and CBV complement each other by enabling transparency throughout the supply chain. EPCIS provides real-time visibility into the movement and status of goods, which means that organizations can track shipments as they move through the supply chain and identify any issues or delays quickly.

CBV provides a common language for describing products and services, which makes it easier for organizations to share information and collaborate to resolve issues. When everyone in the supply chain uses the same terminology to describe products and services, it is easier to identify and resolve issues that may arise.

## Conclusion

As supply chains become increasingly complex and global, the need for standardized systems to enable efficient and effective data exchange and collaboration becomes more important. EPCIS and CBV are two systems that are widely used in supply chain management to enable transparent tracking and tracing of products from the point of origin to the point of consumption.

EPCIS provides a standardized format for capturing and sharing information about the movement and status of goods, while CBV provides a common language for describing products and services. Together, these two systems complement each other by providing standardization, data accuracy, and transparency throughout the supply chain.

By implementing EPCIS and CBV in their supply chain management systems, organizations can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and achieve a more effective and streamlined system overall.
