# The Potential of EPCIS and CBV to Disrupt Business Transformation

Business transformation is a vital process for any organization seeking to adapt to the dynamic and continuously changing business environment. It involves redefining the business model, creating new value propositions, rethinking organizational structures, and adopting new technologies to drive growth and increase operational efficiency. The adoption of EPCIS and CBV technologies can be a disruptive force in this process leading to transformational outcomes.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard for capturing and sharing information about supply chain events in real-time. The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is designed to enable any actor in the supply chain to access real-time information on the status, location, and condition of goods. This standard allows organizations to track goods from the point of origin to the point of consumption in a transparent and efficient manner. This can help organizations improve supply chain visibility, reduce inventory holding costs, and eliminate waste leading to improved operational efficiency.

## What is CBV?

CBV stands for Calculation-Based Verification. It is a technology that allows for the transfer of asset ownership via a verification process through complex mathematical equations. This technology is based on blockchain distributed ledger technology, which allows for secure, tamper-proof transactions without the need for intermediaries. This technology can facilitate streamlined asset transfer between partners, improving the speed of doing business and eliminating the need for intermediaries leading to cost savings.

## How EPCIS and CBV can Disrupt Business Transformation

The adoption of EPCIS and CBV technologies can lead to several transformational outcomes, including:

### Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability

EPCIS provides real-time information about the status, location, and condition of goods in the supply chain, allowing organizations to ensure the integrity of goods while in transit. This information can be used to ensure compliance with regulations, such as Food Safety Modernization Act, and reduce the risk of product recalls. The adoption of EPCIS technology in supply chain ensures transparency, which makes it easy for organizations to attribute responsibility to any party at any time in the value chain, thus eliminating any risk of blame games in case of any errors or mishaps.

### Streamlined Asset Transfer

CBV technology can streamline asset transfer, making it faster and cost-efficient. In the traditional transfer of assets, intermediaries are needed to ensure the authenticity of ownership titles. CBV eliminates the need for intermediaries by using complex mathematical equations to ensure the authenticity of ownership titles. With CBV, parties can be assured of the veracity of asset ownership before conducting a transfer, and the transfer process is facilitated via secure blockchain-based transactions, which eliminates the risk of fraud.

### Improved Operational Efficiency

The adoption of EPCIS and CBV can lead to improved operational efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing competitiveness. EPCIS ensures supply chain visibility, allowing organizations to track and monitor goods while in transit, thus reducing inventory holding costs. This visibility can also help identify bottlenecks, optimize processes, and reduce waste, further increasing operational efficiency. CBV technology eliminates the need for intermediaries, and the time it takes for asset transfer is significantly reduced. This reduction in transfer time can lead to cost savings and improve the speed of conducting business.

### Improved Customer Experience

The improvement of operational efficiency facilitates the faster delivery of goods to the market, which improves customer experience. EPCIS technology ensures supply chain visibility, which makes it easy to identify and resolve supply chain issues that could affect customer satisfaction. Additionally, CBV technology can be used to facilitate the faster transfer of payments, which can lead to faster order fulfillment and improved cash flow, further enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Increased Trust

The adoption of EPCIS and CBV technologies can lead to increased trust between partners in the supply chain. EPCIS technology ensures transparency, which makes it easy to attribute responsibility to any party in the value chain, ensuring all parties are accountable for their actions. This transparency can lead to increased trust between partners, reducing the risk of fraud and errors, which can improve system resilience. Additionally, CBV technology eliminates the need for intermediaries, which can reduce counterparty risk, further increasing trust in the system.

## The Future of EPCIS and CBV

The adoption of EPCIS and CBV technologies will continue to grow as organizations seek to improve their operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance competitiveness. Additionally, with the increasing need for supply chain transparency, EPCIS technology's adoption is poised to grow in the food, pharma, and automotive sectors, where regulators have set stringent compliance requirements.

CBV technology is still in its nascent phase, but it's potential to transform asset transfer is enormous. The adoption of CBV technology will allow for the transfer of assets in a secure and cost-efficient manner, leading to faster business processes and reduced costs. However, it's likely to face regulatory hurdles, especially in sectors such as real estate and finance, where regulatory compliance is crucial.

## Conclusion

The adoption of EPCIS and CBV technologies can lead to transformational outcomes in the business transformation process. Supply chain transparency, streamlined asset transfer, improved operational efficiency, improved customer experience, and increased trust are among the outcomes that businesses can achieve by adopting EPCIS and CBV. As these technologies continue to evolve and mature, organizations must keep pace by embracing them to remain competitive and transform their businesses.
