# How EPCIS & CBV Are Revolutionizing Supply Chain Management

The implementation of advanced technology has always been a defining factor in the evolution of supply chain management. From the use of barcodes and RFID to Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions, organizations have consistently sought new ways to improve their ability to track and manage product movements across the entire supply chain. Today, two new technologies are gaining momentum and promise to revolutionize supply chain management as we know it: EPCIS and CBV.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS, which stands for Electronic Product Code Information Service, is a standardized format to exchange information about products as they move through a supply chain. This technology is based on GS1's EPC (Electronic Product Code) standard, which is a unique identification number for each product that allows supply chain stakeholders to track and manage its movements.

The EPCIS standard enables different organizations to share information about a product's lifecycle, such as its origin, its processing history, its current location, its destination, and its proof of delivery. This information can be exchanged between various systems and organizations, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and regulatory agencies.

## What is CBV?

In contrast to EPCIS, CBV or the Core Business Vocabulary is not a standard in itself, but rather a reference data model that aids in the implementation of the EPCIS standard. CBV provides a consistent and structured way to represent business concepts in EPCIS events, such as product master data, ship-to party, and carrier information.

By providing a standard way to represent business concepts, CBV ensures that different organizations can communicate using a common language. This eliminates confusion and errors when sharing information across supply chain networks.

## Benefits of EPCIS & CBV

EPCIS and CBV have the potential to provide significant benefits to supply chain management systems, including:

### Improved Visibility and Traceability

EPCIS and CBV offer greater visibility and traceability at all levels of the supply chain. This allows organizations to track and monitor shipments in real-time, reducing the risk of lost or missing products, and improving customer satisfaction. Furthermore, EPCIS and CBV provide a complete audit trail of a product's lifecycle, including its origin, quality, and safety information.

### Improved Collaboration

EPCIS and CBV also promote collaboration between different stakeholders in the supply chain. Suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers can share information about a product's lifecycle, enabling more efficient and effective decision making. This may lead to improved processes such as planning and forecasting, inventory management, and cost reduction.

### Increased Efficiency and Cost Savings

EPCIS and CBV allow for automation and optimization of supply chain processes. The real-time monitoring and tracking of products eliminate the need for manual tracking and record-keeping. This leads to reduced human error, lower administrative costs, and faster cycle times. By automating these processes, organizations can reduce costs and improve overall efficiencies.

### Enhanced Compliance and Fraud Prevention

EPCIS and CBV can also help organizations with regulatory compliance and fraud prevention. EPCIS events can store information about product origin, safety, and quality to meet regulatory requirements. Moreover, the tracking and monitoring of products can detect fraudulent activities and reduce the risk of counterfeits.

## Implementation of EPCIS & CBV

The implementation of EPCIS and CBV can be a challenging task, especially for organizations with complex supply chains. However, there are several key considerations that organizations can take into account to ensure a successful implementation:

### Identifying Key Stakeholders

Organizations must identify all stakeholders that will be involved in the EPCIS and CBV implementation process. This includes both internal stakeholders (such as IT, logistics, and compliance teams) and external stakeholders (such as suppliers, carriers, and retailers).

### Defining Use Cases and Business Processes

Once stakeholders are identified, organizations must define the use cases and business processes that will be impacted by EPCIS and CBV. This requires a thorough analysis of current processes, as well as the identification of opportunities for improvement.

### Mapping EPCIS Events and CBV Concepts

After use cases and business processes are defined, organizations must map EPCIS events and CBV concepts to their existing systems and processes. This requires careful consideration of data mapping, data validation, and data transformation rules.

### Testing and Validation

Finally, organizations must conduct thorough testing and validation of their EPCIS and CBV implementations. This includes both functional and non-functional testing, as well as validation of data interoperability with other supply chain stakeholders.

## Conclusion

EPCIS and CBV are two technologies that are revolutionizing supply chain management. By standardizing the exchange of information about products, EPCIS and CBV offer improved visibility and traceability, enhanced collaboration, increased efficiency and cost savings, and enhanced compliance and fraud prevention. Implementing EPCIS and CBV requires a strategic approach, identifying key stakeholders, defining use cases and business processes, mapping EPCIS and CBV to existing systems, and conducting thorough testing and validation. As supply chain management evolves, EPCIS and CBV are essential technologies that must be harnessed to achieve a more efficient and effective supply chain ecosystem.
