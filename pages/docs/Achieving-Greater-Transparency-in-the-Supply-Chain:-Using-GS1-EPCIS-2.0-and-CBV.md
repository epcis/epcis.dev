# Achieving Greater Transparency in the Supply Chain: Using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

The supply chain is a complex web of processes and stakeholders, spanning multiple locations and often involving many different parties. The need for greater transparency and efficiency in the supply chain has never been more pressing, as consumers and governments alike demand more information about the origins and movements of the products they buy.

To help address these challenges, the GS1 organization has developed a number of standards and solutions, including the EPCIS 2.0 and CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) specifications. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at these technologies and explore how they can be used to achieve greater transparency and efficiency in the supply chain.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a GS1 standard that defines a set of interfaces for exchanging information about the location and movement of products and assets within the supply chain. EPCIS allows companies to record and share information about the “events” that occur throughout the supply chain, such as when a product is received, shipped, or delivered.

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the EPCIS standard, and includes a number of improvements and extensions over the previous version. Some of the key features of EPCIS 2.0 include:

- Support for both XML and JSON data formats
- A new “master data” model for defining common data elements across different supply chain applications
- Improved support for cross-company collaboration and data sharing
- Better scalability and performance, with support for distributed architectures and cloud-based deployment models.

Overall, EPCIS 2.0 provides a powerful framework for tracking and managing supply chain events, and can help companies achieve greater visibility and control over their operations.

## What is CBV?

CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is another GS1 standard that defines a set of common data elements and definitions for use within the supply chain. CBV provides a standardized approach to describing and sharing information about products, locations, and other key supply chain entities.

Some of the key benefits of using CBV include:

- Improved data quality and consistency, as all parties use the same terminology and definitions
- Simplified data exchange, as partners can easily understand and interpret the information provided
- Improved efficiency and accuracy, as data can be automatically validated and processed by supply chain applications.

## Using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Transparent Supply Chain Management

So how can EPCIS 2.0 and CBV be used together to achieve greater transparency and efficiency in the supply chain? Let’s explore a few scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Tracking Product Movement and Provenance

One of the key challenges in the supply chain is ensuring that products are genuine, and that they have not been tampered with or substituted at any point in the supply chain. With EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, companies can track the movement and provenance of products at every stage of the supply chain.

For example, a manufacturer could use EPCIS 2.0 to record and share information about the production and shipment of a particular product. This information could include the product’s unique serial number, the date and time it was produced, the location it was shipped from, and so on.

Using CBV, the manufacturer could also provide standardized information about the product itself, such as its SKU, description, and packaging information. This information could be shared with retailers, distributors, and consumers, providing greater visibility and confidence in the authenticity and quality of the product.

### Scenario 2: Traceability and Recall Management

Another important use case for EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is in managing product recalls and other quality issues. By recording and sharing information about product movements and events, companies can quickly identify and track down affected products, reducing the risk of harm to consumers and minimizing the impact on the business.

For example, a retailer could receive a notice of a potential contamination issue with a particular product. Using EPCIS 2.0, the retailer could quickly identify all shipments and events associated with that product, including the supplier, the date of receipt, and the retail stores where it was sold.

Using CBV, the retailer could also provide standard information about the product itself, such as its name, SKU, and description. With this information in hand, the retailer could quickly and efficiently issue a recall notice, alerting customers to the issue and providing instructions on how to return or dispose of the affected product.

### Scenario 3: Improving Supply Chain Efficiency and Sustainability

Finally, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can also be used to drive greater efficiency and sustainability in the supply chain. By tracking and analyzing supply chain events, companies can identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement.

For example, a manufacturer could use EPCIS 2.0 to track the movement of raw materials and finished products, and compare this information against production targets and customer demand. Using CBV, the manufacturer could also track and analyze information about the materials and energy resources used in production, identifying opportunities to reduce waste, improve resource efficiency, and minimize the environmental impact of their operations.

## Conclusion

Achieving greater transparency and efficiency in the supply chain is a key challenge for businesses of all sizes and industries. By leveraging standards such as EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, companies can gain greater visibility and control over their operations, and provide consumers and other stakeholders with the information they need to make informed decisions.

Whether you are a manufacturer, retailer, or logistics provider, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help you to optimize your supply chain and achieve your sustainability goals. So consider adopting these standards in your own operations, and reap the benefits of a more transparent and efficient supply chain.
