# Breaking Down the Technical Details of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

## Introduction

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a comprehensive standard for exchanging supply chain data. It is designed to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility by enabling businesses to share data in a standardized format. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of this standard, and it comes with many improvements over the previous version.

EPCIS 2.0 introduces the concept of "BizSteps," which are a set of standardized business processes that are commonly used in supply chain operations. These BizSteps enable businesses to exchange information about supply chain events in a standardized manner, thus improving the interoperability and traceability of supply chain data.

In this article, we'll take a closer look at the technical details of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps and how they work.

## BizSteps Overview

BizSteps are a set of standardized business processes that describe the different stages of a supply chain transaction. They are defined using a combination of XML and JSON formats, which allow businesses to exchange data across different systems.

There are nine types of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, each of which corresponds to a specific stage in the supply chain process.

1. Product source
2. Product transformation
3. Product aggregation
4. Transport
5. Receive
6. Commission
7. Decommission
8. Observation
9. Exception

## How BizSteps Work

When a product enters a supply chain, it goes through a series of stages or BizSteps. At each stage, specific data about the product is captured and recorded in the EPCIS system. This data is associated with a unique identifier called a "Global Trade Item Number" (GTIN).

For example, when a product is manufactured, it goes through the "Product Transformation" BizStep. During this stage, information about the product's components, production date, and manufacturer is captured and recorded. This information is then stored in the EPCIS system.

Later, when the product is shipped to a warehouse, it goes through the "Transport" BizStep. During this stage, information about the shipment, such as its carrier and transport date, is recorded in the EPCIS system.

At each subsequent stage, additional data is captured and associated with the product's GTIN. This data includes information about the product's location, condition, and other relevant details.

## Benefits of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0

There are several benefits to using BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, including:

### Standardization

One of the primary benefits of BizSteps is that they provide a standardized way of capturing and exchanging supply chain data. This standardization promotes interoperability between different supply chain systems and reduces the need for manual data entry and reconciliation.

### Traceability

By capturing data at each stage of the supply chain, BizSteps enable businesses to track products and their associated data from the source to the final destination. This traceability can improve efficiency and reduce the risk of errors or fraud.

### Visibility

BizSteps also provide greater visibility into supply chain operations by enabling businesses to track and analyze data in real-time. This transparency can help businesses identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions.

### Efficiency

By automating the capture and exchange of supply chain data, BizSteps can reduce the time and cost associated with manual data entry and reconciliation. This efficiency can help businesses operate more effectively and reduce waste.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps are a powerful tool for improving supply chain visibility, traceability, and efficiency. By providing a standardized way of capturing and exchanging data at each stage of the supply chain, businesses can better understand and optimize their operations. As the supply chain landscape continues to evolve, BizSteps will likely become even more valuable in ensuring the smooth flow of goods and information.
