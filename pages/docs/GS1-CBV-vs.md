# GS1 CBV vs Other Standardized Barcode Systems

Barcodes are essential in modern commerce and are used in almost every industry. They are found on products, packaging, shipping containers, and even medical equipment. In retail, barcodes are used to identify products and track inventory, and in healthcare, they are used to track medical devices and patient data. GS1 CBV (Global Standard One Cross Industry Barcode Verification) is a barcode system that offers several benefits over other standardized barcode systems like UPC and EAN. In this post, we will compare the GS1 CBV barcode system to other standardized barcode systems.

## GS1 CBV Vs. UPC

UPC (Universal Product Code) is a standardized barcode system that has been in use since the 1970s. It is a 12-digit barcode that is used primarily in North America. In contrast, GS1 CBV is a global barcode system that is used in over 150 countries. The most significant difference between the two is that UPC barcodes do not include any information other than the product number, whereas GS1 CBV barcodes can include additional data like product weight, expiry date, and batch number.

Another key difference between the two is the way in which they are assigned. UPC codes are assigned by GS1 US, while GS1 CBV codes are assigned by the global GS1 organization. This means that GS1 CBV codes are more versatile, as they can be used in any country that recognizes the GS1 system.

## GS1 CBV Vs. EAN

EAN (European Article Numbering) is the European equivalent of UPC. Like UPC, it is a 12-digit barcode that is primarily used in Europe. GS1 CBV and EAN are similar in many ways, but there are a few key differences.

One significant difference is in the way the barcodes are assigned. GS1 CBV codes are assigned by the global GS1 organization, while EAN codes are assigned by local GS1 organizations. This means that EAN codes are not as versatile as GS1 CBV codes, as they are only recognized within the specific country where they were assigned.

Another key difference is the number of digits in the barcode. EAN barcodes can have either 13 or 8 digits, while GS1 CBV barcodes always have 13 digits. This means that GS1 CBV barcodes can hold more data than EAN barcodes, making them more versatile for businesses that require more data to be stored in their barcodes.

Finally, GS1 CBV barcodes offer higher levels of data accuracy because they are verified using a standardized verification process. EAN barcodes do not have this standardized verification process, which can lead to errors and discrepancies in data.

## GS1 CBV Vs. Code 128

Code 128 is a commonly used barcode format that can hold alphanumeric characters. It is used in a range of industries, including healthcare, shipping, and supply chain management. In contrast, GS1 CBV is a barcode system that is specifically designed for use in the retail and healthcare industries.

Another major difference between the two is the way that the barcodes are structured. Code 128 barcodes can be any length, and the information they contain is not standardized. GS1 CBV barcodes have a set structure, which includes a standard prefix, the product number, and any additional data elements.

Finally, GS1 CBV barcodes have a higher level of accuracy than Code 128 barcodes because they are verified using a standardized verification process. Code 128 barcodes do not have this standardized verification process, which can lead to errors and discrepancies in data.

## Conclusion

GS1 CBV is a barcode system that offers several benefits over other standardized barcode systems. It is a global system that can be used in over 150 countries and can include additional data like product weight, expiry date, and batch number. It is assigned by the global GS1 organization, which makes it more versatile than UPC and EAN barcodes. GS1 CBV barcodes also offer higher levels of data accuracy because they are verified using a standardized verification process. Overall, GS1 CBV is an excellent choice for businesses that require a versatile, accurate and standardized barcode system that can be used globally.
