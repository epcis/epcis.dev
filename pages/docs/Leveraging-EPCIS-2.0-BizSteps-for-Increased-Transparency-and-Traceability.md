# Leveraging EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps for Increased Transparency and Traceability

In recent years, supply chain transparency has been a major focus for businesses across a variety of industries. Consumers are increasingly demanding to know where their products come from, the conditions in which they were produced, and whether they were ethically sourced. This has led to a rise in the popularity of blockchain technology, which provides an immutable ledger of all transactions across the supply chain.

However, blockchain is not the only tool available for increasing transparency and traceability. EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps is another powerful solution that can help businesses achieve these goals. In this blog post, we will explore what EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps is, how it works, and how businesses can leverage it for increased transparency and traceability.

## What is EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps?

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a standard created by GS1, a global standards organization, to provide visibility and traceability in supply chains. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of this standard and provides several improvements over the previous version, including support for event-based architectures, better integration with IoT technologies, and expanded data exchange capabilities.

BizSteps, on the other hand, is a framework that provides a common vocabulary for describing business processes in supply chains. It was created by the Open Applications Group (OAGi), a not-for-profit standards organization that provides a framework for developing and implementing business processes in a consistent and standardized way.

When combined, EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps provide a powerful solution for increased transparency and traceability in supply chains. BizSteps provides the framework for defining business processes, while EPCIS 2.0 provides the technology for tracking and monitoring those processes.

## How does EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps work?

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps works by providing a standard way to describe and track business processes in a supply chain. The framework provides a common language for defining events (such as the receipt of a shipment or the completion of a manufacturing process) and actions (such as the addition of a product label or the creation of a purchase order).

When these events and actions are recorded using EPCIS 2.0, the result is a complete audit trail of all activity within the supply chain. This audit trail can be accessed by any authorized participant in the supply chain, providing full transparency and traceability.
