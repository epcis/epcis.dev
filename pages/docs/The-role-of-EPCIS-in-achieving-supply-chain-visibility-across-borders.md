# The role of EPCIS in achieving supply chain visibility across borders

With the increasing globalization of the supply chain, achieving complete visibility across borders has become a major challenge for many businesses. Supply chain visibility is defined as the ability to track and trace products and materials as they move through the supply chain, from the point of origin to the final destination. 

One of the key technologies that has emerged in recent years to help achieve this visibility is the Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS). EPCIS is an internationally recognized standard for tracking and tracing products, and it has the ability to provide real-time visibility into the location, movement, and status of products as they move through the supply chain.

In this blog post, we will examine the key benefits of EPCIS and explore how it can help businesses achieve supply chain visibility across borders.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard developed by GS1, an international organization that develops and maintains standards for supply chain management. The EPCIS standard defines a standardized format for recording and sharing information about the movement of products through the supply chain.

The EPCIS standard is based on the use of a unique identifier called the Electronic Product Code (EPC). EPCs are assigned to individual products or groups of products, and they can be used to track and trace products as they move through the supply chain.

EPCIS provides a standardized way to record and share information about the movement of products through the supply chain using EPCs. This information can include the location of the product, the time it arrived at a particular location, and information about any events that occurred during its journey.

## The benefits of EPCIS

The key benefits of EPCIS are the ability to provide real-time visibility into the supply chain, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall supply chain management.

### Real-time visibility

One of the primary benefits of EPCIS is the ability to provide real-time visibility into the supply chain. EPCIS enables businesses to track and trace products in real-time, providing a clear picture of where products are at any given point in time. This real-time visibility can help businesses to identify and resolve any issues that arise during the supply chain journey, such as delays, lost or damaged products, or other issues that may impact the delivery of the product to the end customer.

### Improved operational efficiency

EPCIS can also improve operational efficiency by streamlining supply chain processes. By using a standardized system for tracking and tracing products, businesses can reduce the time and resources required to manage the supply chain. This can lead to significant cost savings, as well as improved productivity and operational efficiency.

### Enhanced supply chain management

Finally, EPCIS can enhance overall supply chain management by providing businesses with a more complete picture of the supply chain. EPCIS enables businesses to track and trace products from the point of origin to the final destination, providing insight into every step of the journey. By having this level of visibility, businesses can identify areas for improvement and optimize the supply chain to improve overall performance.

## Achieving supply chain visibility across borders with EPCIS 

One of the biggest challenges in achieving supply chain visibility across borders is the lack of standardization in supply chain management practices. Different countries have different regulations and requirements for the handling of goods, and this can lead to significant delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain.

EPCIS can help to overcome these challenges by providing a standardized system for tracking and tracing products. EPCIS enables businesses to use a common language for communicating information about the movement of products through the supply chain, regardless of the country or region.

Another benefit of EPCIS is the ability to integrate with other supply chain technologies, such as blockchain and IoT technologies. Blockchain enables businesses to create a tamper-proof, auditable record of the movement of products through the supply chain, while IoT technologies enable businesses to track and monitor products in real-time.

By integrating EPCIS with these technologies, businesses can achieve end-to-end supply chain visibility across borders. This can help to reduce the risk of delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall supply chain management.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, achieving complete supply chain visibility across borders is a complex challenge that requires the use of advanced technologies and standardized practices. EPCIS offers a standardized system for tracking and tracing products, providing real-time visibility into the supply chain, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing overall supply chain management.

By integrating EPCIS with other supply chain technologies, businesses can achieve end-to-end supply chain visibility across borders. This can help them to overcome the challenges of global supply chain management, reduce the risk of delays and inefficiencies, and improve overall supply chain performance. As such, EPCIS is an essential tool for businesses seeking to achieve supply chain visibility in today's global economy.
