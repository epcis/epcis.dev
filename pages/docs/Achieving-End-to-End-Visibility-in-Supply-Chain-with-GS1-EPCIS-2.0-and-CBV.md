# Achieving End-to-End Visibility in Supply Chain with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

As businesses increasingly rely on global supply chains, the need for end-to-end visibility has become paramount. The ability to track and trace products as they move through the supply chain is crucial for ensuring transparency, efficiency, and compliance. The GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards provide a comprehensive framework for achieving this level of visibility. In this post, we will explore these standards, their features, and how they can be implemented to achieve end-to-end visibility.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standard developed by the GS1 organization, a global authority on supply chain standards. EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, and it enables businesses to capture and share large amounts of data about their products as they move through the supply chain. This data includes information such as the product's origin, its current location, and its status.

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of this standard and is designed to be more flexible, scalable, and interoperable than its predecessors. It incorporates technologies such as RFID and blockchain to provide greater accuracy and security in data sharing.

## What is CBV?

CBV stands for Core Business Vocabulary and is a set of standardized terms and definitions that are used to describe products in the supply chain. CBV was developed by GS1 to provide a common language for businesses to use when describing their products. This helps to ensure that everyone in the supply chain is using the same terms and definitions to describe products, reducing confusion and errors.

CBV is based on the UN/CEFACT Data Type Library, which is a comprehensive set of standard data types for electronic data interchange. It includes a wide range of product attributes, such as weight, dimensions, and packaging.

## How GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV work together

The combination of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provides a powerful framework for achieving end-to-end visibility in the supply chain. By using EPCIS to capture and share data about products as they move through the supply chain, and CBV to provide a standardized way of describing those products, businesses can achieve greater visibility and control over their supply chains.

For example, a manufacturer might use EPCIS to capture data about a product's origin, such as the country of manufacture and the date of production. This data can then be shared with the rest of the supply chain, using CBV to ensure that everyone understands the product's attributes and properties.

As the product moves through the supply chain, EPCIS can be used to track its location and status, providing real-time visibility into its movement. CBV can be used to provide additional information about the product, such as its weight, dimensions, and packaging.

## Benefits of using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

The benefits of using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for achieving end-to-end visibility are numerous. Here are just a few:

### Real-time visibility

By tracking products in real-time as they move through the supply chain, businesses can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies and take action to address them quickly. This can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.

### Compliance

Regulations such as the FDA's Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) require businesses to have greater visibility into their supply chains. By using EPCIS and CBV, businesses can achieve the level of transparency required for compliance.

### Improved collaboration

By using a common language to describe products, businesses can collaborate more effectively with their partners in the supply chain. This can lead to greater efficiency, improved communication, and better outcomes for all parties.

### Enhanced security

By incorporating technologies such as blockchain into EPCIS 2.0, businesses can provide greater security in data sharing. This can help to reduce the risk of theft, fraud, and other security breaches.

## Implementing GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

Implementing GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can be a complex process, but there are a few key steps that businesses can take to get started:

### 1. Understand your data needs

Before implementing EPCIS and CBV, businesses should first understand their data needs. This includes understanding what data needs to be captured, how it will be used, and who will have access to it.

### 2. Choose a technology provider

Businesses will need to choose a technology provider that can provide the necessary tools and infrastructure for implementing EPCIS and CBV. This may involve selecting an RFID provider, a blockchain provider, or both.

### 3. Develop a data sharing strategy

Businesses will need to develop a strategy for sharing data with their partners in the supply chain. This may involve establishing data sharing agreements, setting up data sharing platforms, and establishing protocols for data sharing.

### 4. Train users

Finally, businesses will need to train their users on how to use EPCIS and CBV effectively. This may involve providing training on how to capture data, how to share data, and how to interpret the data that is captured.

## Conclusion

Achieving end-to-end visibility in the supply chain is crucial for ensuring transparency, efficiency, and compliance. The GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards provide a comprehensive framework for achieving this level of visibility. By using EPCIS to capture and share data about products as they move through the supply chain, and CBV to provide a standardized way of describing those products, businesses can achieve greater visibility and control over their supply chains. Although implementing these standards can be complex, the benefits in terms of real-time visibility, compliance, collaboration, and security make it well worth the effort.
