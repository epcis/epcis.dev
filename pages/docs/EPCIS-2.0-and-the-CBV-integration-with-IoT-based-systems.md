# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV integration with IoT-based systems:

The EPCIS 2.0 standard and the CBV integration with IoT-based systems are two of the most significant technological advancements that are currently driving the transformation of various industries. EPCIS 2.0 is a standardized protocol that aims to improve supply chain visibility by providing a centralized infrastructure for tracking and tracing products across various entities. CBV, on the other hand, is a data format that enables efficient data management between applications, limiting the need for costly custom integrations. The integration of the two technologies in IoT-based systems presents tremendous opportunities for innovation and optimization. 

## EPCIS 2.0 Overview:
EPCIS 2.0 is an extension of the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard developed by GS1. It is a standard protocol for exchanging information about the movements and status of physical products, enabling entities in a supply chain to gather, share and access information about products within their network. The EPCIS 2.0 protocol builds on the previous EPCIS standard by incorporating new features such as advanced querying options, improved data models, and event schemas.

EPCIS focuses on capturing data concerning the movements of products as they move throughout the supply chain. This data includes when the product was shipped, received, stored, and when it was transferred between entities. The collected data is then used by companies to optimize their supply chain processes, improve product visibility, and provide end-to-end traceability.

## CBV Overview:
The Common Business Vocabulary (CBV), developed by GS1, is another standard protocol designed to facilitate communication between different applications. It is a data format that defines a common set of data elements that can be used to communicate information about products, organizations, locations, and other entities. With CBV, businesses can simplify the integration of different applications by using a common set of data terms, limiting the need for complex custom integrations.

CBV employs a standardized terminology of variables that can be easily exchanged between systems. This helps in the smooth communication between different business processes, making it easier for disparate systems to work together for the common good of the supply chain. 

## Impact of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Integration with IoT-based systems: 

The integration of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with IoT-based systems presents businesses with the potential to optimize supply chain processes by enabling real-time data sharing and analytics, resulting in streamlined supply chain management, improved productivity, and enhanced accuracy.

One area that stands to benefit significantly from these technologiesâ€™ integration is the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical supply chain is highly regulated, and with increased transparency from EPCIS 2.0, it would be easier to detect counterfeit drugs or any anomalies in the supply chain. This would significantly reduce the significant issue of counterfeit drugs in the market, decreasing the number of consumer casualties and lost profits. The integration with IoT-based devices could also improve the healthcare system by allowing healthcare providers to track vaccines' movement easily, therefore preventing loss of vaccines through mishandling, making it available to those who need it. 

In retail, the integration of these technologies could optimize inventory management, improving product availability, and reducing overstocking. With real-time data sharing, businesses will be able to anticipate demand and quickly respond with timely supply.

## Benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Integration with IoT-based systems:

** 1. Increased Productivity**

The integration of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with IoT-based systems enables real-time, accurate data sharing between systems, driving productivity in the supply chain. Businesses can optimize their operations by accessing real-time information to improve decision-making and streamline processes that may have previously taken hours or days to accomplish.

** 2. Reduced Costs**

Cost savings is a significant driver for businesses, and integration with IoT-based systems enables cost savings by optimizing inventory management and reducing the need for manual tracking of products. With EPCIS 2.0 and CBV integration, accessing accurate, real-time information about the products will help companies in the supply chain improve their operations and reduce management expenses.

** 3. Enhanced Visibility**

With EPCIS 2.0 and CBV integration in IoT-based systems, businesses will have complete supply chain visibility, from manufacturer to customer. This provides a useful tool for tracking products that are recalled or identified as faulty in real-time, limiting revenue loss and improving customer relations. 

## Conclusion:

The integration of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with IoT-based systems comes with various benefits that would significantly impact businesses in the supply chain. Improved productivity, reduced operations costs, and enhanced visibility of the entire supply chain would streamline the supply chain process and result in increased profits. 

As technologies continue to evolve, it's essential to take advantage of solutions like CBV and EPCIS 2.0 to stay ahead of the curve. Integration with IoT-based systems provides businesses with the means to gather real-time data that can be used to optimize every aspect of their operations. As business keeps going digital, more and more industries will discover the benefits of this technology, making the future of supply chain management more manageable, more secure and efficient.
