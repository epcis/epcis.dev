# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV Case Studies: Lessons Learned

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 is a powerful tool that is transforming the way businesses approach supply chain management. EPCIS 2.0 offers real-time, end-to-end visibility into a company's entire supply chain, ensuring transparency and traceability. In this post, we will explore how EPCIS 2.0 has been used in real-world applications, specifically in the case of CBV, and the lessons that can be learned from these case studies.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS is a standard that was developed by the global supply chain community to address the need for real-time visibility across the supply chain. EPCIS 2.0 builds on the original EPCIS standard, extending its capabilities to provide enhanced support for track and trace across multiple participants and providing a number of new features and functions that support real-time visibility and traceability in supply chains. EPCIS 2.0 is particularly useful because it can provide real-time monitoring and visibility of every stage of the supply chain of everything on the Internet of Things.

## The CBV Case Study

CBV is a leading provider of industrial gases, with a significant presence in the North American market. The company recently implemented EPCIS 2.0 to provide better visibility and traceability across its entire supply chain. The company's supply chain spanned several locations and involved multiple partners, making it a complex and challenging environment to manage.

With EPCIS 2.0, CBV was able to achieve complete transparency across its supply chain, allowing the company to track every single product from the moment it was manufactured, through to the moment it left the factory, and beyond. This was achieved through the use of RFID tags that were placed on each product, allowing CBV to track each product's movement through the supply chain.

CBV also used EPCIS 2.0 to gain real-time visibility into the state of its stock levels, ensuring that it always had the right amount of products on hand to meet customer demand. This allowed CBV to optimise its inventory management processes, reducing the amount of time and money spent on managing its stock levels.

## Lessons Learned

The CBV case study provides us with a number of key lessons that can be applied to other businesses looking to implement EPCIS 2.0 in their supply chains:

### 1. Real-time visibility is key

One of the most important benefits of EPCIS 2.0 is the ability to gain real-time visibility across the entire supply chain. This is critical for businesses, as it allows them to quickly identify any issues that may arise and take action to resolve them before they become major problems. Real-time visibility also allows companies to optimise their supply chain processes, reducing the amount of time and money spent on managing inventory levels, and improving overall supply chain efficiency.

### 2. Collaboration is essential

CBV's success with EPCIS 2.0 was due to a close collaboration between the company and its supply chain partners. By working together to implement EPCIS 2.0, the company was able to achieve complete visibility across its entire supply chain, including information on its partners' movements and stock levels. Collaboration is essential for businesses looking to implement EPCIS 2.0, as it ensures that everyone is working towards a common goal and that all parties are aware of their roles and responsibilities.

### 3. Focus on the customer

Finally, the CBV case study highlights the importance of focusing on the customer. By implementing EPCIS 2.0, CBV was able to provide better customer service by ensuring that it always had the right amount of products on hand to meet demand. This not only improved customer satisfaction levels but also helped to drive sales and increase revenue.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 is changing the way businesses approach supply chain management, providing real-time visibility and traceability across the entire supply chain. The CBV case study provides valuable insights into how businesses can successfully implement EPCIS 2.0, including the importance of real-time visibility, collaboration, and customer focus. Businesses that are able to take these lessons on board and successfully implement EPCIS 2.0 will be well-positioned to succeed in today's fast-paced, competitive business environment.
