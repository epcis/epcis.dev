# Understanding the Benefits of EPCIS for the Healthcare Supply Chain

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is emerging as the most promising technology for managing the supply chain of the healthcare industry. This technology offers enhanced visibility, security and efficiency to the healthcare supply chain. It is a standardized format for sharing information between different stakeholders in the supply chain. EPCIS leverages the unique identification of products, patients, and locations.

In this article, we will delve deeper into the benefits of EPCIS in the healthcare supply chain.

## Traceability

Traceability is the ability to track products through the supply chain. In the healthcare industry, the ability to trace each medical device, drug, and patient throughout the supply chain is of utmost importance. Traceability helps to ensure that patients receive safe and effective healthcare products. The EPCIS offers an efficient way to achieve traceability through standardized data sharing.

With EPCIS, every product in the supply chain is assigned a unique EPC identifier. This identifier is used to track the product from the manufacturer to the distributor to the healthcare provider. The healthcare provider can use the EPC identifier to retrieve information about the product, including its origin, manufacturing details, and expiration date.

## Improved Efficiency

Efficiency is a critical component of any supply chain, and the healthcare industry is no exception. EPCIS can help the healthcare supply chain become more efficient by providing real-time visibility into the location and status of products. This helps to prevent stockouts and delays while ensuring that products are delivered in a timely fashion.

EPCIS has the ability to track the movement of products at each stage of the supply chain. This tracking enables the healthcare provider to know exactly where a product is located and when it will arrive. This information can be used to optimize the supply chain and ensure that products are always available when needed.

## Reduced Counterfeiting

Counterfeit drugs pose a significant threat to the healthcare industry. They can harm patients, affect the efficacy of drugs, and destabilize the healthcare system. EPCIS can help to combat counterfeiting by enabling the tracking of every drug from the manufacturer to the patient.

The unique EPC identifier assigned to each drug can be used to verify the authenticity of the drug. The healthcare provider can scan the EPC identifier on the drug and retrieve information about the product, including its origin and manufacturing details. This information can be used to identify counterfeit drugs and remove them from the supply chain.

## Improved Patient Safety

Patient safety is the top priority of the healthcare industry. The use of incorrect drugs or devices can cause harm to patients. EPCIS can improve patient safety by providing real-time visibility of products in the supply chain.

EPCIS is capable of tracking medical devices and drugs from the manufacturer to the patient. This enables the healthcare provider to ensure that the correct product is delivered to the patient. It also enables the healthcare provider to monitor the expiration date of the product and ensure that expired products are not used.

## Cost Reduction

The healthcare industry is one of the most expensive industries in the world. EPCIS can help to reduce costs by improving the efficiency of the supply chain. The improved efficiency of the supply chain enables the healthcare provider to optimize inventory management, reduce stockouts, and minimize waste.

EPCIS can also help to reduce costs by reducing counterfeiting. Counterfeit drugs are often more expensive than genuine drugs, and their use can increase the cost of healthcare. The use of EPCIS to combat counterfeiting can help to reduce the cost of healthcare.

## Conclusion

EPCIS is emerging as the most promising technology for managing the supply chain of the healthcare industry. It offers enhanced visibility, security, and efficiency to the healthcare supply chain. The application of EPCIS in the healthcare industry can provide numerous benefits, including traceability, improved efficiency, reduced counterfeiting, improved patient safety, and cost reduction.

The healthcare industry is a critical industry that has a direct impact on the health and wellbeing of people. EPCIS can help to improve patient safety and ensure that patients receive safe and effective healthcare products. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare supply chain and transform the healthcare industry.
