# Using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV to Build Brand Trust

Today's consumers care more about ethical business practices and the origins of the products they purchase than ever before. In fact, one survey found that 77% of consumers make purchases based on a company's social and environmental impact. As the importance of transparency and sustainability increases, companies must find ways to assure their customers that their values align with their purchasing decisions. Enter EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV.

## What is EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV?

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a global standard for sharing and retrieving supply chain event data. EPCIS 2.0 has expanded upon the original EPCIS standard to include more data elements and increase flexibility. This allows for more comprehensive tracking and sharing of supply chain information.

The CBV, or Core Business Vocabulary, is a set of standardized terms used for sharing information within the supply chain. It provides a common language for businesses to communicate with one another and ensures that everyone is on the same page.

By using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV together, companies can create a more efficient and transparent supply chain. This increased transparency can help build trust and credibility with customers.

## Building Brand Trust with EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

One of the most significant benefits of using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is the ability to track products throughout the supply chain. This allows for more accurate and transparent communication with customers about the origins and journey of the products they purchase.

For example, a food company could track the ingredients in their products from the farm to the grocery store. They could then use EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV to share this information with customers. This would allow customers to see where the product came from, how it was produced, and how it was transported.

In addition to providing customers with transparent information about the supply chain, companies can also use EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV to ensure their products meet certain ethical standards. For example, a clothing brand could track the factories in which their products are produced and ensure that they meet certain labor standards. They could then promote this information to customers to build trust and credibility.

Another benefit of using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is the ability to quickly identify and isolate potential issues in the supply chain. For example, if a food product is found to be contaminated, the company could use EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV to quickly track the affected products and remove them from store shelves.

This increased transparency and accountability can help build trust with customers. By providing detailed information about the origin and journey of products, companies can demonstrate their commitment to ethical and sustainable practices. This can help to build a loyal customer base that values these same principles.

## Challenges of Implementing EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

While the benefits of using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are significant, there are also challenges to implementing these standards in the supply chain.

One challenge is the need for a standardized approach across the entire supply chain. Without a standardized approach, it can be difficult to integrate and share supply chain data effectively.

Another challenge is the need to ensure data privacy and security. As supply chain data is shared more widely, it becomes increasingly important to protect this information from potential breaches.

Finally, there is a need for investment in technology and training to implement EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV effectively. While these technologies can improve supply chain efficiency and customer trust, they require significant investment and resources.

## Conclusion

As the importance of transparency and sustainability continues to grow, companies must find ways to build trust and credibility with consumers. EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provide a powerful tool for achieving this goal. By tracking products throughout the supply chain and sharing this information with customers, companies can demonstrate their commitment to ethical and sustainable practices. While there are challenges to implementing these standards, the potential benefits make the investment worthwhile. For companies that prioritize transparency and accountability, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV offer a powerful tool for building a loyal customer base and ensuring long-term success.
