# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV for Compliance with Regulations and Standards

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard has been designed to allow businesses to share supply chain data with their trading partners. With the advent of EPCIS 2.0, there has been a renewed interest in the Common Business Vocabulary (CBV) as a key component of EPCIS compliance with regulations and standards.

In this blog post, we will discuss EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, and explore how they can be used to ensure compliance with regulations and standards.

## EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the EPCIS standard, which was developed by the GS1 organization to allow businesses to share supply chain data with their trading partners. EPCIS 2.0 is an improvement over the earlier version of EPCIS, with a number of new features and enhancements.

One of the key benefits of EPCIS 2.0 is that it allows for the sharing of data in real-time, which is critical for businesses that operate in fast-paced environments. Additionally, EPCIS 2.0 provides a flexible data model that can be customized to meet the specific needs of different industries.

EPCIS 2.0 is also designed to support the use of standards-based data exchange protocols, such as REST and SOAP. This makes it easier for businesses to integrate EPCIS with their existing systems and workflows.

## Common Business Vocabulary (CBV)

The Common Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a standard set of terms and definitions that are used to describe supply chain data. The CBV was developed by the GS1 organization to provide a common language for businesses to use when sharing supply chain information.

The CBV includes a number of standardized terms, such as “Product Description” and “Quantity”, which are used to describe different aspects of supply chain data. By using the CBV, businesses can ensure that their trading partners have a clear understanding of the data that is being shared.

## Compliance with Regulations and Standards

In order to ensure compliance with regulations and standards, it is important for businesses to use standardized approaches and common vocabularies when sharing supply chain data.

One of the key benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is that they provide businesses with a standardized approach to sharing supply chain data. With EPCIS 2.0, businesses can share real-time data with their trading partners, while using the CBV to ensure that the data is accurately described and understood.

In addition to providing a standardized approach to sharing supply chain data, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can also help businesses comply with specific regulations and standards.

For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to track the movement of their products through the supply chain, in order to prevent counterfeit drugs from entering the market. By using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, pharmaceutical manufacturers can easily track their products and share this information with their trading partners, in order to comply with FDA regulations.

Similarly, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires businesses to protect the privacy of personal data. By using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, businesses can ensure that any personal data that is shared through the supply chain is accurately described and protected, in order to comply with GDPR regulations.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are important tools for businesses that need to share supply chain data with their trading partners. By using these tools, businesses can ensure that their data is accurately described, and that it is shared in a standardized and compliant manner.

Whether you are a pharmaceutical manufacturer that needs to comply with FDA regulations, or a retailer that wants to protect the privacy of personal data, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can help you achieve your compliance goals.

By embracing these standards and tools, businesses can transform the way they share supply chain data, and achieve better collaboration and efficiency with their trading partners.
