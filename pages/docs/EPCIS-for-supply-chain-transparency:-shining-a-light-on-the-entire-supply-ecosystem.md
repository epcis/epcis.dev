# EPCIS for supply chain transparency: shining a light on the entire supply ecosystem

As global supply chains continue to become more complex, organizations are struggling to maintain visibility into the provenance of their products. The emergence of the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard has provided businesses with a powerful tool to track items across their entire supply chain.

In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of EPCIS for supply chain transparency and highlight some of the ways in which this technology is being leveraged by organizations around the world.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a set of specifications that define how information about a product's movements across the supply chain should be captured and shared. The standard was developed by the GS1 organization, which specializes in the creation and implementation of global standards for the supply chain.

At its core, EPCIS is all about creating a shared "source of truth" for product movements. By aggregating data from various sources, EPCIS provides a high-level view of where products are at any given time and how they got there.

## Benefits of EPCIS for supply chain transparency

There are several key benefits to using EPCIS for supply chain transparency:

### Greater visibility into the supply chain

EPCIS provides businesses with a birds-eye view of their entire supply chain, affording them greater visibility into the provenance of their products. This makes it easier to identify and isolate issues should a problem arise and provides valuable insights into the way products move through the supply chain.

### Improved efficiency

By automating the capture and sharing of supply chain data, EPCIS can help businesses streamline their operations and improve efficiency. This can result in faster turnaround times, reduced waste, and improved customer satisfaction.

### Enhanced traceability

One of the most significant benefits of EPCIS is its ability to provide enhanced traceability for products. By capturing data at every point in the supply chain, organizations can quickly identify the origin of any issues and take corrective action if needed.

## How EPCIS is being used in the real world

EPCIS is being used by organizations across a wide range of industries to improve supply chain transparency. Here are just a few examples of how this technology is being leveraged in the real world:

### Pharmaceutical supply chains

Pharmaceutical companies are using EPCIS to maintain the integrity of their supply chains and comply with regulatory requirements. By using EPCIS to track the movements of prescription drugs from manufacturer to patient, these companies can ensure that their products are handled correctly and avoid issues such as counterfeiting.

### Food and beverage supply chains

EPCIS is also being used in the food and beverage industry to improve supply chain transparency. By tracking food products from the farm to the supermarket, companies can identify and isolate any potential contamination issues and prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses.

### Automotive supply chains

Finally, EPCIS is being used in the automotive industry to track the movement of car parts across the supply chain. By capturing data on the origin and quality of these parts, manufacturers can ensure that their vehicles are safe and reliable.

## Challenges to implementing EPCIS

While the benefits of EPCIS are clear, there are several challenges that organizations must overcome to successfully implement this technology:

### Data standardization

In order for EPCIS to work effectively, all organizations involved in the supply chain must adhere to a common data standard. Achieving this level of standardization can be challenging, as different organizations may have different data collection methods and technologies.

### Integration with existing systems

Integrating EPCIS with existing systems such as ERPs and CRMs can be a complex process. Organizations must carefully plan and execute this integration to ensure that the two systems work seamlessly together.

### Managing vast amounts of data

EPCIS generates vast amounts of data that must be collected, stored, and analyzed. Organizations must have the necessary infrastructure in place to handle this data and interpret it effectively.

## Conclusion

As global supply chains continue to become more complex, organizations must find ways to maintain visibility into their operations. EPCIS provides a powerful tool that can help businesses achieve this goal by providing enhanced traceability and greater visibility into the supply chain.

While there are several challenges to implementing EPCIS, organizations that can overcome these challenges are well positioned to reap the benefits of this technology. By ensuring that their products are safe and reliable, businesses can build trust with their customers and stakeholders and compete effectively in the global marketplace.
