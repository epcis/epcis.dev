# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV for End-to-End Supply Chain Security

In today's global economy, supply chain security is of utmost importance. Supply chain actors need to be able to reliably track and trace goods as they move throughout the supply chain. This is where EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV come into play. In this article, we will explore what EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are, and how they can be used to enhance end-to-end supply chain security.

## EPCIS 2.0 - An Overview

EPCIS 2.0, or Electronic Product Code Information Services 2.0, is a standards-based framework for sharing and querying event data related to supply chain events. In simpler terms, it's a way to share information about the movement of goods throughout the supply chain.

The EPCIS 2.0 standard consists of three main components:

- **Events**: The actual data points that are generated as goods move through the supply chain. These events include information such as the date and time of the event, the location of the event, and any additional data about the event (such as product information or shipment details).
- **Queries**: Tools that allow supply chain actors to search for specific events within the EPCIS 2.0 system. These queries can be based on a wide range of criteria, such as product type, location, or date.
- **Interfaces**: The interfaces that allow different supply chain actors (such as manufacturers, retailers, and logistics providers) to input and extract data from the EPCIS 2.0 system.

With EPCIS 2.0, supply chain actors can create a detailed, real-time picture of where goods are at any point in the supply chain. This can help to enhance transparency, reduce inventory costs, and improve supply chain efficiency.

## The CBV - A New Security Standard for EPCIS 2.0

While EPCIS 2.0 provides a robust framework for sharing and querying supply chain event data, it does not inherently provide any security guarantees. This is where the CBV, or Core Business Vocabulary, comes into play.

The CBV is a set of standardized terms and concepts that are defined within the EPCIS 2.0 standard. These terms provide a common language for supply chain actors to use when discussing supply chain security.

Some of the key concepts defined within the CBV include:

- **Aggregation**: The process of combining individual items into larger units (such as pallets, cases, or cartons). Aggregation plays an important role in supply chain security, as it allows supply chain actors to track larger units of goods as they move through the supply chain.
- **Disaggregation**: The opposite of aggregation, the process of breaking larger units back down into individual items. Disaggregation is important for tracking movements of individual items in the supply chain.
- **Ownership**: The concept of who controls goods at any given point in the supply chain. Ownership can be transferred multiple times throughout the supply chain, and it is important to be able to track who owns goods at any given time.
- **Location**: The physical location of goods within the supply chain. Tracking the location of goods is important for ensuring that they have not been diverted or stolen.
- **Authentication**: The process of verifying that goods are authentic, and have not been counterfeited or tampered with.

By using the CBV as part of their EPCIS 2.0 implementation, supply chain actors can ensure that they are speaking a common language when it comes to supply chain security. This can help to enhance collaboration and cooperation among different supply chain actors, ultimately improving end-to-end supply chain security.

## How EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV Enhance Supply Chain Security

So, how exactly do EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV enhance end-to-end supply chain security? Let's take a closer look at some of the key benefits:

### Enhanced Visibility

One of the primary benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is enhanced visibility into the supply chain. By tracking goods in real-time, supply chain actors can identify and respond to potential security threats more quickly and effectively. For example, if a shipment of goods appears to be moving off-course or taking longer than expected to reach its destination, supply chain actors can investigate and take appropriate action.

### Improved Collaboration

Another benefit of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is improved collaboration among supply chain actors. By using a common language and shared framework for tracking goods, supply chain actors can better coordinate their efforts to ensure end-to-end supply chain security. For example, a manufacturer might share product authentication data with a logistics provider, enabling the logistics provider to verify the authenticity of the products they are handling.

### Reduced Risk of Counterfeiting and Tampering

By using the CBV to track goods throughout the supply chain, supply chain actors can more easily identify and respond to potential counterfeiting and tampering threats. For example, if a shipment of goods changes ownership multiple times in a short period, this could indicate potential tampering with the goods.

### Greater Traceability

Finally, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV enable greater traceability of goods throughout the supply chain. This can help supply chain actors to identify the source of security threats and take appropriate action. For example, if a particular supplier consistently provides goods with security vulnerabilities, that supplier can be identified and either eliminated or required to improve their security practices.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provide a powerful framework for enhancing end-to-end supply chain security. By providing enhanced visibility, improved collaboration, reduced risk of counterfeiting and tampering, and greater traceability, these standards can help to ensure that goods move securely and efficiently throughout the supply chain. As the global economy continues to become more complex and interconnected, the need for robust supply chain security will only continue to grow. EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provide an important step forward in meeting this challenge.
