# Why You Should Consider Adopting GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Your Business

As the world becomes more digital and interconnected, businesses are under constant pressure to upgrade their systems to keep up with changing technologies and customer expectations. One technology that is gaining traction in the supply chain industry is GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. Adopting this standard can provide a wealth of benefits to businesses that are looking to improve their supply chain visibility and efficiency.

## An Introduction to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

GS1 EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a globally recognized standard for capturing and sharing supply chain events and data. It was developed by GS1, a nonprofit organization that provides globally recognized standards for supply chain management.

EPCIS enables businesses to share data about their products and processes in a standard, structured format that can be easily understood by trading partners. This data includes information about the product’s origin, production process, location, and movement throughout the supply chain.

CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a subset of EPCIS that provides a standardized set of terms and definitions for supply chain events and data. It simplifies the implementation of EPCIS by ensuring that everyone speaks the same “language” when it comes to supply chain data.

## Benefits of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Adoption

1. Increased Supply Chain Visibility

One of the primary benefits of adopting GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is increased supply chain visibility. By capturing and sharing data about product movement and location, businesses can track their products in real-time, identify bottlenecks, and gain insight into potential issues before they become critical. This level of visibility allows businesses to optimize their supply chain operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

2. Improved Data Quality

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide a standardized format for data exchange, which results in improved data quality. It reduces the likelihood of errors caused by manual data entry, and everyone uses the same terminology when describing supply chain events, improving consistency and accuracy.

3. Better Compliance with Regulations

Regulators around the world are increasingly requiring detailed tracking and reporting of goods throughout the supply chain. Adopting GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help businesses comply with these regulations more easily and accurately. The standard provides a framework for tracking and reporting that simplifies the process for businesses and regulators alike.

4. Increased Operational Efficiency

By having a standardized format for supply chain data, businesses can integrate their systems more easily and automate processes where possible. This leads to increased operational efficiency and productivity.

5. Enhanced Collaboration with Trading Partners

In a complex and global supply chain, businesses need to collaborate closely with their trading partners to operate efficiently. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide a common language and framework for data sharing that makes collaboration more straightforward.

6. Improved Customer Satisfaction

Supply chain visibility is increasingly important to customers, who want to know where their products are and when they will arrive. By adopting GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, businesses can provide their customers with real-time tracking information and increase their overall satisfaction with the purchasing experience.
