# The Role of EPCIS in Improving Supply Chain Customer Experience

In today's fast-paced business environment, supply chain customer experience has become a critical differentiator for businesses. Customers expect their orders to be delivered on time, with minimum errors, and at a reasonable price. To satisfy these demands, businesses must focus on improving their supply chain processes.

One way businesses can improve their supply chain processes is by using EPCIS, a standardized system designed to track products as they move through the supply chain. EPCIS provides a standardized framework for tracking products, making it easier for businesses to share data with partners and customers, reducing errors and improving the customer experience.

In this blog post, we will discuss the role of EPCIS in improving supply chain customer experience and how it can help businesses win customer loyalty and gain a competitive advantage.

## What is EPCIS?

Before we dive into the role of EPCIS in improving supply chain customer experience, let's take a brief look at what EPCIS is and how it works.

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information System. It is a standard developed by GS1, a global organization that provides standards for the supply chain industry. EPCIS allows businesses to track products as they move through the supply chain, enabling them to see where a product is at any given time.

EPCIS works by using unique identification numbers called Electronic Product Codes (EPCs) to track products. Each product has a specific EPC, which is scanned and recorded at each point in the supply chain. This data is then stored in a centralized database, which can be accessed by authorized partners and customers.

EPCIS provides businesses with real-time visibility into their supply chain. They can quickly identify and address issues that could lead to delays or errors, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

## The Importance of Customer Experience

Customer experience has become a buzzword in recent years, and for a good reason. According to a study by PwC, 86% of customers are willing to pay more for a better customer experience.

Customers expect their orders to be delivered on time, with minimum errors, and at a reasonable price. Any delays or errors during the supply chain process can lead to dissatisfied customers and lost revenue.

Businesses must focus on improving their supply chain processes to deliver the best possible customer experience. And this is where EPCIS comes into play.

## The Role of EPCIS in Improving Supply Chain Customer Experience

EPCIS can play a critical role in improving supply chain customer experience. Here's how:

### Real-time tracking and visibility

EPCIS provides businesses with real-time tracking and visibility into their supply chain, enabling them to see where a product is at any given time. This visibility allows them to identify any delays or issues that could lead to errors and act quickly to resolve them.

For example, if a delivery is delayed due to bad weather or traffic, the business can inform the customer and provide them with a revised delivery time. This proactive approach reduces customer frustration and demonstrates transparency, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

### Improved accuracy and reduced errors

EPCIS reduces the likelihood of errors in the supply chain, leading to improved accuracy, and increased customer satisfaction. For example, businesses can use EPCIS to track inventory levels in real-time, ensuring that they have enough stock to fulfill customer orders.

EPCIS also enables businesses to automate their supply chain processes, reducing the need for manual intervention. This automation reduces the possibility of errors and improves the accuracy and reliability of the supply chain process.

### Enhanced collaboration and communication

EPCIS provides a standardized framework for tracking products, making it easier for businesses to share data with partners and customers. This enhanced collaboration and communication lead to improved efficiency and a better customer experience.

For example, a business can share real-time delivery updates with the customer, keeping them informed about the status of their order. This transparency and communication demonstrate the business's commitment to delivering the best possible customer experience.

### Cost savings

EPCIS enables businesses to optimize their supply chain processes, leading to cost savings. By tracking products in real-time, businesses can identify areas where they can improve efficiency and reduce waste.

For example, a business can identify areas where they are overstocked or understocked, leading to reduced waste and lower costs. Cost savings can be passed on to customers, reducing prices, and improving the customer experience.

## Conclusion

EPCIS plays a critical role in improving supply chain customer experience. By providing real-time tracking and visibility, improving accuracy and reducing errors, enhancing collaboration and communication, and reducing costs, EPCIS enables businesses to deliver the best possible customer experience.

In today's competitive business environment, businesses cannot afford to ignore the customer experience. By leveraging EPCIS, businesses can win customer loyalty, gain a competitive advantage, and ensure their long-term success.
