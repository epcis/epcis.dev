# A Comprehensive Guide to EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

If you work in the supply chain industry, you must be familiar with EPCIS 2.0 and its use cases. EPCIS 2.0 is the second version of the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard developed by GS1, a global organization that creates and manages standards for supply chain management. EPCIS 2.0 improves upon its predecessor, EPCIS 1.2, by adding several new features, including support for blockchain-based data sharing, advanced event querying, and more granular product data modeling. 

One of the most important features of EPCIS 2.0 is its ability to standardize the business steps involved in supply chain transactions. These business steps, also known as BizSteps, are pre-defined actions that take place during the lifecycle of a product in the supply chain. By standardizing BizSteps using EPCIS 2.0, companies can share and access data in a consistent format, resulting in improved collaboration, supply chain visibility, and operational efficiency.

In this blog post, we will be discussing what BizSteps are, how to define them, and how to use them effectively with EPCIS 2.0.

## What are BizSteps?

BizSteps are pre-defined actions that occur during supply chain processes such as manufacturing, storage, and transportation. Each BizStep represents a specific action that takes place within a supply chain transaction, e.g., "Packaging," "Receiving," "Shipment," etc. The BizSteps are defined so that they are consistent across different supply chain systems, products, and industries.

In EPCIS 2.0, the BizSteps are represented as events. Each event is associated with a specific BizStep, which provides contextual information about the event. The use of standardized BizSteps allows companies to share data in a consistent and predictable format, enabling improved collaboration and supply chain visibility.

## Defining BizSteps

The first step in using BizSteps with EPCIS 2.0 is to define them. A BizStep is defined using a BizStep template, which specifies details such as the purpose of the BizStep, the input and output data associated with the BizStep, and any constraints or requirements on that data.

When defining a BizStep, it is important to consider the different types of data that will be associated with it. For example, a "Shipment" BizStep may require information such as the destination address, the quantity and type of product being shipped, and the shipping carrier. A "Receipt" BizStep, on the other hand, may require information such as the date and time of receipt, the product identification number, and the receiving party's name and address.

Once the BizSteps have been defined, they can be integrated into the supply chain ecosystem to ensure that data is captured and shared consistently across different systems.

## Using BizSteps with EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 provides a set of standardized APIs for recording and transmitting BizStep data. These APIs enable companies to share data with partners and stakeholders in a consistent format, regardless of the systems used by each partner.

To use BizSteps with EPCIS 2.0, it is important to understand the structure of EPCIS events. Each event contains several mandatory and optional fields, including the event time, event type, and BizStep. The BizStep field is used to indicate the type of action being taken, such as "Manufacturing," "Shipment," or "Receipt."

When creating an EPCIS event, the BizStep field should be set to the appropriate BizStep associated with the action being taken. For example, if a shipment is being sent, the BizStep field should be set to "Shipment." This makes it easier for partners and systems to understand the context of the event and what actions are being taken.

## Benefits of Using BizSteps with EPCIS 2.0

Standardizing BizSteps with EPCIS 2.0 offers several benefits to companies in the supply chain industry. These benefits include:

### Improved Collaboration

By using standardized BizSteps, companies can communicate and share data with partners and stakeholders more effectively. This improves collaboration and reduces the risk of misinterpretation or errors caused by inconsistent data structures.

### Increased Operational Efficiency

Standardizing BizSteps allows companies to automate processes and share data across multiple systems more easily. This increases operational efficiency and reduces the need for manual data entry and management.

### Enhanced Supply Chain Visibility

Standardized BizSteps provide more granular and transparent data about supply chain transactions. This enables companies to track products more effectively and make data-driven decisions about inventory, logistics, and other critical aspects of the supply chain.

### Support for Emerging Technologies

EPCIS 2.0 supports emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, and the Internet of Things. By standardizing BizSteps using EPCIS 2.0, companies can ensure that their data is compatible with these technologies and can be integrated seamlessly into their supply chain systems.

## Conclusion

Standardizing BizSteps using EPCIS 2.0 is an essential step for companies looking to improve collaboration, operational efficiency, and supply chain visibility. By defining and using standardized BizSteps, companies can ensure that their data is consistent and predictable across different systems and industries. This enables them to make data-driven decisions and optimize their supply chain operations for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.
