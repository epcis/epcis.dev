# EPCIS and CBV Adoption in Healthcare: An Overview

## Introduction

Over the past few years, the healthcare industry has been undergoing a major digital transformation. With advancements in technology such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), barcodes, RFID, and IoT sensors, the industry is moving towards greater efficiency, transparency, and better outcomes for patients. One key component of this transformation is the adoption of the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) standards. In this blog post, we'll take a deep dive into these standards and their adoption in the healthcare industry.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard developed by GS1, a global organization that focuses on developing and maintaining standards for supply chain management. EPCIS provides a standardized way of sharing and communicating information about the movement and location of products and assets in the supply chain. This includes information such as the location, time, and status of a product, which can be tracked using barcodes, RFID, and other sensor technologies.

## What is CBV?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of standardized terms and definitions for use in supply chain information systems. It provides a common language for different organizations to communicate the same information in a consistent manner. By using CBV, businesses can ensure that their supply chain partners understand the same definitions and terms, which helps to prevent miscommunication and errors.

## How EPCIS and CBV are used together

EPCIS and CBV are used together to provide a complete solution for supply chain management. EPCIS provides the means to track and trace products and assets, while CBV provides a standardized language to communicate the information about those products and assets between different organizations. This enables businesses to have greater visibility into their supply chain, which can lead to increased efficiency, decreased costs, and better customer service.

## Adoption in healthcare

The healthcare industry has been slow to adopt EPCIS and CBV, but that is changing rapidly. There are several reasons for this delayed adoption, including a lack of understanding about the benefits of the standards and the complexity of implementation.

However, there are several benefits to adopting EPCIS and CBV in healthcare:

- Improved patient safety: By tracking the movement of products and assets throughout the supply chain, healthcare providers can ensure that patients receive the correct medication, equipment, and supplies.
- Increased efficiency: By having a standardized language for communicating supply chain information, healthcare providers can reduce errors and delays.
- Better inventory management: By having greater visibility into the supply chain, healthcare providers can better manage inventory levels, reduce waste, and avoid stockouts.
- Regulatory compliance: Adopting EPCIS and CBV can help healthcare organizations comply with regulations such as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) and the Unique Device Identification (UDI) rule.

## Implementation challenges

While there are clear benefits to adopting EPCIS and CBV, there are also challenges to implementation. One major challenge is the complexity of integrating the standards into existing systems. Healthcare providers have complex IT systems that need to be updated to support EPCIS and CBV. This may require significant investment in new technology and training for staff.

Another challenge is the need for collaboration between different organizations in the supply chain. Healthcare providers depend on suppliers, distributors, and logistics companies to deliver products and assets. All of these organizations need to adopt EPCIS and CBV for the standards to be effective. This requires close collaboration and communication between all parties.

## Future of EPCIS and CBV in healthcare

Despite the challenges, the adoption of EPCIS and CBV in healthcare is growing. In 2013, the FDA proposed the DSCSA, which requires the adoption of EPCIS and CBV for tracking and tracing drugs in the supply chain. This has driven adoption of the standards in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, major healthcare providers such as Mayo Clinic and Cardinal Health have already begun implementing EPCIS and CBV in their supply chain management systems.

As the benefits of EPCIS and CBV become more widely understood and the technology to implement the standards becomes more accessible, we can expect greater adoption in the healthcare industry. This will lead to increased efficiency, improved patient safety, and better outcomes for all stakeholders in the supply chain.

## Conclusion

EPCIS and CBV are emerging as key standards for supply chain management in healthcare. By providing a standardized language for communicating information about products and assets, and a way of tracking those items throughout the supply chain, EPCIS and CBV can help healthcare providers improve patient safety, increase efficiency, and better manage inventory. While there are challenges to implementing the standards, the benefits are clear. As the healthcare industry continues to undergo a digital transformation, we can expect to see greater adoption of EPCIS and CBV in the years to come.
