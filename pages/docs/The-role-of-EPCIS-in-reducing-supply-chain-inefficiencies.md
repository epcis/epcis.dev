# The role of EPCIS in reducing supply chain inefficiencies

Supply chain management is becoming an increasingly complex web of operations, particularly in today’s digital age where numerous parties play a critical role in keeping the process moving. Given this complexity, it is no surprise that supply chain inefficiencies are common occurrences. 

Fortunately, the advent of Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) has made it possible to mitigate supply chain inefficiencies. EPCIS is a standardized data format, which provides uniformity and interoperability between supply chain participants, thereby enabling data sharing and collaboration. In this post, we will delve into the role that EPCIS plays in reducing supply chain inefficiencies.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standardized data format that provides a structured framework for data sharing amongst supply chain participants. The data format is governed by the EPCglobal community, a non-profit organization that enables the adoption and implementation of Electronic Product Code (EPC)-enabled RFID systems.  

EPCIS is designed to allow supply chain participants to share critical supply chain event data in real-time. The data is shared in a standardized, uniform format, such as what time a product was manufactured, what time it left the factory, who shipped it, when it arrived at the retailer, and who purchased it. EPCIS provides the standardization required to enable the sharing of event data in supply chains while ensuring that the data maintains its integrity.

## The benefits of EPCIS in supply chain management

EPCIS offers multiple benefits and advantages that contribute to the reduction of supply chain inefficiencies. In the following paragraphs, we discuss some of the key benefits of using EPCIS in supply chain management.

### Improved supply chain visibility

EPCIS offers improved supply chain visibility, allowing supply chain participants to monitor the movement of goods from the source to the end-user. This increased visibility is critical in improving the supply chain process as it enables accurate tracking of inventory and more precise order management.

For instance, retailers can monitor inventory levels and detect when a certain product is running low on stock, which translates into more accurate production planning and inventory management. Furthermore, EPCIS can provide real-time product location data, making it easier for shippers to track and monitor the shipment process, ensuring that products arrive at their destinations on time.

### Enhanced data accuracy

EPCIS ensures that data remains accurate throughout the supply chain process, improving the accuracy of inventory levels and enabling more precise order management. Through the use of EPCIS, every supply chain participant contributes to a complete picture of the supply chain process, which ensures that the data is accurate, reliable and up to date.

This accuracy and reliability can help businesses gauge demand and identify areas that require improvement in their supply chain to increase efficiency. EPCIS provides the necessary transparency in the supply chain, reducing the number of errors and mismatches that frequently occur in traditional supply chain processes.

### Reduced operational costs

EPCIS enables companies to reduce their operational costs by streamlining processes and reducing the number of errors that occur in traditional supply chain procedures. When it comes to traditional supply chain management, manual systems are often used to manage inventory and order tracking. This approach is labor-intensive, inefficient and prone to errors.

With EPCIS, supply chain participants can automate many of these procedures, reducing the time and effort required to manage inventory and track orders. This automation reduces operational costs, as fewer manual procedures are needed, and the likelihood of mistakes and errors are minimized.

### Increased supply chain efficiency

EPCIS enables faster decision-making and enables supply chain participants to take appropriate action quickly. The real-time data provided by EPCIS enables supply chain participants to intervene promptly and efficiently when an issue arises, avoiding further delays or negative effects on the supply chain process.

The increased supply chain efficiency means that companies can respond to customer demands faster, reduce production and delivery time, and bring products to market quicker. This increased efficiency can also translate into cost savings and increased profits.

## Common use cases for EPCIS

EPCIS can be used in various supply chain processes, depending on the specific requirements of the operating environment. Here are some common use cases where EPCIS can be deployed in the supply chain.

### Product authentication

EPCIS can be used to authenticate products through the creation of a traceability trail. This traceability trail provides supply chain participants with the necessary data to verify the authenticity of goods, identify counterfeits, and track product recalls more easily.

### Delivery management

EPCIS can be used for real-time delivery management, enabling supply chain participants to monitor the delivery progress of a product from source to destination. The data provided by EPCIS allows for more accurate and efficient delivery management and eliminates the need for manual tracking procedures.

### Inventory management

EPCIS enables accurate and real-time inventory management. Supply chain participants can track inventory levels, detect low levels of inventory, and adjust accordingly. This increased accuracy ensures that companies maintain optimal inventory levels and avoid stock-outs, leading to increased customer satisfaction.

## Key takeaways

EPCIS plays a critical role in reducing supply chain inefficiencies by enabling supply chain participants to share information in a standardized manner. The benefits of EPCIS include improved supply chain visibility, enhanced data accuracy, reduced operational costs and increased supply chain efficiency.

EPCIS is an essential tool for businesses looking to streamline their supply chain and enhance their supply chain management process. With the increasing complexity of today’s supply chain, companies that embrace EPCIS will benefit from more accurate and efficient supply chain management, reduced costs, increased profits, and higher customer satisfaction.
