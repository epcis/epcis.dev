# How the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0 Can Streamline Your Supply Chain

Supply chain management has always been an essential aspect of running a successful business. In recent years, however, it has become even more critical, as customers are increasingly demanding faster delivery times and real-time visibility into the movement of goods. To keep up with this demand, businesses need a more agile and streamlined supply chain.

One solution to achieving a more optimized supply chain is EPCIS 2.0. EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, which is a standard developed by GS1 - a global standards organization for supply chain management. The EPCIS standard enables companies to capture and share supply chain data in real-time, allowing for end-to-end visibility and traceability.

At the core of EPCIS 2.0 are the BizSteps, which are a set of standardized events that capture supply chain data from end to end. In this blog post, we'll explore the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0 and how they can help streamline your supply chain.

## BizStep 1: Ship

The first BizStep in the EPCIS 2.0 standard is "Ship." This step occurs when a shipment leaves the sender's facility and begins its journey to the destination. At this step, the sender generates an Electronic Product Code (EPC) for each item the shipment contains. The EPC is a unique identifier that allows for accurate tracking of each item within the shipment.

Capturing data at the Ship BizStep can help streamline the supply chain by providing real-time visibility into the shipment's movement. Companies can use this data to track shipments, optimize transportation routes, and identify potential issues before they become problems.

## BizStep 2: Receive

The next BizStep in the EPCIS 2.0 standard is "Receive." This step occurs when the shipment arrives at its destination and is received by the recipient. At this step, the recipient scans each item's EPC to confirm receipt and update inventory levels.

Capturing data at the Receive BizStep can help streamline the supply chain by improving inventory accuracy and reducing the time it takes to restock inventory. By having real-time inventory data, companies can quickly identify when stock levels are running low and reorder products before running out of stock.

## BizStep 3: Aggregation

The third BizStep in the EPCIS 2.0 standard is "Aggregation." This step occurs when items are grouped together into a higher-level unit, such as a case or pallet. At this step, each item's EPC is recorded, and a unique identifier is generated for the higher-level unit.

Capturing data at the Aggregation BizStep can help streamline the supply chain by improving supply chain visibility and reducing the time it takes to pick and pack orders. By having accurate information on the contents of each higher-level unit, companies can quickly identify the items they need to pick and pack orders.

## BizStep 4: Commission

The fourth BizStep in the EPCIS 2.0 standard is "Commission." This step occurs when a product or service is sold to a customer. At this step, the product's EPC is recorded along with other relevant data, such as the price, customer information, and payment details.

Capturing data at the Commission BizStep can help streamline the supply chain by improving demand forecasting and reducing the time it takes to process orders. By having real-time data on customer orders, companies can quickly identify trends and adjust their production schedules to meet demand.

## BizStep 5: Decommission

The fifth BizStep in the EPCIS 2.0 standard is "Decommission." This step occurs when a product or service is removed from inventory, either through a sale or other methods. At this step, the product's EPC is recorded, along with other relevant data, such as the reason for removal and the final destination.

Capturing data at the Decommission BizStep can help streamline the supply chain by improving inventory management and reducing the time it takes to restock inventory. By having real-time data on inventory levels, companies can quickly identify when stock levels are running low and reorder products before running out of stock.

## BizStep 6: Observe

The final BizStep in the EPCIS 2.0 standard is "Observe." This step occurs when supply chain events are observed but do not fall into the other BizSteps. For example, an equipment malfunction that causes a shipment delay would be recorded at the Observe BizStep.

Capturing data at the Observe BizStep can help streamline the supply chain by providing real-time visibility into potential issues that may arise. By identifying issues early on, companies can take steps to address them before they become costly problems.

## Conclusion

Overall, the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0 can help streamline your supply chain by providing real-time visibility into the movement of goods from end to end. By capturing supply chain data at each step of the process, companies can better manage their inventory levels, reduce the time it takes to process orders, and identify potential issues before they become problems.

If you're looking to optimize your supply chain and improve customer satisfaction, adopting EPCIS 2.0 and the BizSteps standard is an excellent place to start. By implementing this standard, you'll be able to streamline your supply chain and stay ahead of the competition.
