# A Deeper Dive into CBV in the Context of GS1 EPCIS 2.0

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standardized protocol for tracking and tracing products along the supply chain. It enables businesses to share and exchange information about products, including their location, status, and other relevant data points. GS1 EPCIS is built on top of a number of other GS1 standards, all of which are designed to make the exchange of product information more efficient and standardized.

One of the key concepts underlying GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is CBV – or “Core Business Vocabulary.” In this article, we’ll take a deeper dive into CBV and explore what it means in the context of GS1 EPCIS 2.0.

## What is CBV?

At its most basic level, CBV is a standardized set of data elements that businesses can use to describe their products. These data elements cover a wide range of product-related information, such as the product’s name, weight and dimensions, and the materials used to make it.

What makes CBV so useful is that it provides a common language that businesses can use to describe their products. This common language makes it easier for different businesses to share information about the same product, even if they use different internal systems to manage that information.

## Using CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0

While CBV has many potential use cases, it is particularly useful when used in conjunction with GS1 EPCIS 2.0. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is designed to be a highly flexible and extensible data exchange protocol. This means that businesses can use it to exchange any kind of data they need to track and trace products along the supply chain.

However, this flexibility can also be a double-edged sword. Without a common vocabulary to describe products, two different businesses might interpret the same product-related information in vastly different ways. This could lead to miscommunication and errors down the line.

CBV helps to solve this problem by providing a pre-defined set of product-related data elements that businesses can use to describe their products when exchanging information via GS1 EPCIS 2.0. This ensures that all businesses are speaking the same language when it comes to describing their products.

## An Example Use Case

To better understand how CBV is used in the context of GS1 EPCIS 2.0, let’s look at an example use case.

Imagine that you are a manufacturer of a new line of shoes. To track and trace your products along the supply chain, you will need to exchange information about your shoes with various other businesses, such as your suppliers, distributors, and retailers.

To exchange this information, you could use GS1 EPCIS 2.0. However, without a common vocabulary to describe your shoes, there is a risk that other businesses may misunderstand the information you provide. For example, one retailer might interpret “shoe size” to mean the size of the shoe box, while another might interpret it to mean the size of the shoes themselves.

To avoid this confusion, you could use CBV to describe your shoes in a standardized way. For example, you might describe your shoes using the following CBV data elements:

- Name: “Acme Running Shoe”
- Weight: 1 pound, 2 ounces
- Color: Blue
- Manufacturer: Acme Shoes
- Size: 9

By using CBV, you ensure that all businesses you exchange information with understand the same details about your shoes.

## Advantages of Using CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0

There are many advantages to using CBV in conjunction with GS1 EPCIS 2.0. Here are just a few:

### Standardization

By providing a common vocabulary for describing products, CBV ensures that all businesses involved in the supply chain are speaking the same language. This can help to prevent misunderstandings and errors down the line.

### Efficiency

By using pre-defined data elements to describe products, businesses can exchange product-related information more efficiently. This can save time and money, as there is no need to create custom data exchange protocols for each product.

### Flexibility

While CBV provides a standardized set of data elements for product descriptions, it is also flexible enough to allow for customization. Businesses can add additional data elements as needed to describe their products in greater detail.

## Conclusion

CBV is a powerful tool for businesses looking to exchange information about their products in a standardized and efficient way. When used in conjunction with GS1 EPCIS 2.0, CBV helps to ensure that all businesses involved in the supply chain are speaking the same language when it comes to product-related information. This can lead to increased efficiency, fewer errors, and ultimately, better products for consumers.
