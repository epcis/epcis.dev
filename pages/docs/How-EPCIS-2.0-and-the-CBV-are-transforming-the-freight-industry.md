# How EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are transforming the freight industry

Throughout the years, the freight industry has experienced several evolutions, from the use of manual processes to the integration of advanced technologies. Nowadays, technological advancements such as EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have transformed the freight industry in ways that were unimaginable in the past.

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are two advanced technologies that have revolutionized the freight industry, making it more efficient, secure, and transparent. In this blog post, we will discuss how these two technologies are transforming the freight industry.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is a standard way to document and share information about the movements and whereabouts of goods in the supply chain. EPCIS 2.0 enables stakeholders to exchange information seamlessly and securely, enhancing supply chain visibility and transparency.

EPCIS 2.0 provides businesses with precise information on the location, condition, and ownership of goods as they move through the supply chain. The technology helps businesses track and trace products in real-time, allowing them to quickly identify and address inefficiencies and issues.

The technology also ensures that critical information is shared universally across the supply chain, providing a uniform reference point for all stakeholders.

## What is the CBV?

The CBV or Cross-Border Verifications is a system that leverages the power of blockchain technology to facilitate secure cross-border trade. The CBV is a unique digital identification system that verifies the legitimacy of goods crossing international borders.

The technology allows for the tracking of goods from their origin to their destination, providing a clear and transparent view of the entire supply chain process.

The CBV technology is tamper-proof, providing a secure and transparent connection between trade partners, eliminating the need for intermediaries, and reducing the overall cost of doing business.

## How EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are transforming the freight industry

Integration of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV technologies into the freight industry has resulted in notable changes such as:

### Improved Efficiency

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV technologies have made it possible for freight industry stakeholders to track and trace goods in real-time. This has enabled businesses to develop automated systems that streamline current processes.

Automated systems such as warehouse management systems, transportation management systems, and enterprise resource planning systems are connected to EPCIS 2.0 and CBV technologies, resulting in increased efficiency in operations. This leads to shorter lead times and faster delivery of goods.

### Enhanced Security

With the integration of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV technologies, the overall security of the freight industry has improved. EPCIS 2.0 provides a standardized set of rules and regulations governing information sharing to ensure compliance and adherence to industry standards.

Moreover, the CBV system verifies the identity of the trade partners, ensuring the security of goods passing through international borders. The CBV also eliminates the need for intermediaries by creating a direct connection between trade partners, further enhancing security.

### Greater Transparency

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV technologies have made the freight industry more transparent than ever before. These technologies provide businesses with real-time data on the location, ownership, and condition of goods, creating a fully visible supply chain.

This transparency has led to an increase in customer trust, as businesses can use this information to verify the authenticity of goods and ensure that they are delivered on time, in perfect condition.

### Improved Compliance

Compliance regulations are an essential aspect of the freight industry, and non-compliance can result in severe consequences. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV technologies have made it easier for businesses to comply with regulatory standards.

EPCIS 2.0 provides businesses with a standardized system for information sharing, ensuring compliance with regulations. The CBV, on the other hand, provides businesses with digitized and verified documentation, simplifying the compliance process and reducing the risk of penalties.

## The Future of the Freight Industry 

The integration of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV technologies into the freight industry is just the beginning. The freight industry is poised for even more significant advancements in the future, as these technologies continue to evolve.

The future of the freight industry will rely on more advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. These technologies will enhance the efficiency, security, and transparency of the freight industry, enabling businesses to deliver better service to their customers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have transformed the freight industry in several ways. They have made the industry more efficient, secure, transparent, and compliant. These technologies have laid the foundation for more advanced technologies that will continue to shape the industry in the future.

The freight industry must embrace these technologies if it is to remain competitive in the years to come. Businesses that adopt these technologies can optimize their operations, drive revenue, and improve customer satisfaction. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are indeed transforming the freight industry, and the best is yet to come.
