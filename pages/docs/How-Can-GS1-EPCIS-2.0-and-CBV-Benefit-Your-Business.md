# How Can GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Benefit Your Business?

In today's supply chain industry, data sharing and visibility are key factors for success. GS1 EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) 2.0 is an international standard for sharing real-time information about products as they move through the supply chain, while CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a set of standardized business terms and definitions that provide a common language for data exchange between trading partners. Together, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV enable businesses to enhance visibility and transparency, reduce errors, and improve efficiency.

## The Importance of GS1 EPCIS 2.0

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 enables businesses to share real-time information about their products as they move through the supply chain. This allows businesses to track their products from the point of origin to the point of sale, which can help in reducing errors, preventing fraud, and ensuring product safety. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 also provides a standardized framework for data exchange, ensuring that all parties are using the same format and terminology, which can be particularly beneficial for multinational corporations.

Another advantage of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is its ability to enable end-to-end supply chain visibility. By integrating data from various sources, such as RFID tags or barcodes, with other supply chain data, businesses can gain real-time visibility into the movement of their products. This helps in identifying potential bottlenecks, optimizing inventory levels, and improving forecast accuracy.

## The Benefits of CBV

CBV is a set of standardized business terms and definitions that provide a common language for data exchange between trading partners. By having a standardized set of terms, businesses can avoid confusion and errors that can arise from using different terminology. For example, if one party refers to a product as "shoes," while another refers to it as "footwear," this can lead to confusion and errors in data exchange. By using CBV's standardized terminology, all parties can use the same language for clear communication.

CBV also enables businesses to use data more efficiently. By having a standardized set of terms, businesses can easily integrate data from different sources, such as external data sources or their own internal systems. This can improve workflow and make data analysis and reporting more accurate and efficient.

## How GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Work Together

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV complement each other. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 provides the framework for sharing real-time information about products as they move through the supply chain, while CBV provides a common language for data exchange between trading partners.
