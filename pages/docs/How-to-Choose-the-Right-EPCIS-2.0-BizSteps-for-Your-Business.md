# How to Choose the Right EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps for Your Business

EPCIS 2.0 is an electronic product code (EPC) information standard that provides a platform for tracking and tracing products throughout the supply chain. Its main purpose is to provide a shared view of the movement of goods and product information to stakeholders, which can come in handy for several business use cases. This article will discuss how to choose the right BizSteps for your business when working with EPCIS 2.0.

## What Are BizSteps?

BizSteps are business steps that describe the actions that take place when moving products through the supply chain. They provide a standard definition of events for all parties involved in the supply chain, creating a common language for the sharing of information. The use of BizSteps is essential when implementing EPCIS 2.0, as it standardizes the information exchange.

EPCIS 2.0 defines four different BizSteps that can be used to track the movement of products through the supply chain:

- Desire: This Bizstep captures the desire or intention to make a specific product or SKU. It is the first step in the product creation process.
- Produce: This BizStep captures the production or manufacturing of a product. It involves the conversion of raw material into finished goods.
- Pack: This BizStep captures the packaging of a product into a unit of sale. It includes building cases or pallets for transportation.
- Ship: This BizStep captures the shipment of the product from one location to another. It includes the transportation of the product to its final destination.

## Analyze Your Business Needs

The first step in choosing the right BizSteps for your business is to analyze your business needs. The process of doing so revolves around understanding your logistics, goals, and objectives. Once you have a clear understanding of your business requirements, it becomes easier to determine which BizSteps are necessary for your operation.

For example, if your business is a food manufacturer looking to improve traceability in your supply chain, you might want to consider using all four BizSteps. Using Desire and Produce BizSteps, you can track the production of your raw materials and finished goods accurately. The Pack and Ship BizSteps will help you track the transportation of your products from the manufacturing facility to the end consumer.

## Determine the Data You Need to Collect

The next step is to determine the data you need to collect to achieve the business objectives you have identified. The data required varies depending on the type of business you are running or the product you are manufacturing. To make your analysis easier, it's essential to involve all stakeholders in the supply chain, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.

Once you have determined the data you need to track, you can now look at which BizSteps will help you achieve your business objectives. For instance, if you want to track the origin of raw materials, you'll need to capture data on the location and type of raw material used in the production process. This data can be recorded using the Desire and Produce BizSteps.

## Consider the Costs

When choosing the right BizSteps for your business, it's essential to consider the costs involved in implementing the solution. The primary cost is associated with the technology required to capture the data at each BizStep. Depending on your business process and supplier relationships, implementing some BizSteps may be more costly than others. Consider working with all stakeholders to determine the most feasible approach.

## Evaluate the Risks

Another critical factor to consider when choosing the right BizSteps for your business is the risks involved. It's essential to evaluate the risks for each potential BizStep during the product movement.

For example, using the Ship BizStep to track the movement of a product from the manufacturing facility to the end consumer can help you trace the origin of any issues that arise during the transportation process. However, the chance of theft or damage to the product during transportation also needs to be taken into account when evaluating the risk.

## Engage with a Trusted Partner

Choosing the right BizSteps for your business is a critical decision that requires an in-depth understanding of your business and supply chain. It's essential to engage with a trusted technology partner to help you achieve your objectives. A partner with experience in EPCIS 2.0 provides key insights to determine the most effective BizSteps for your business based on your unique supply chain requirements.

Working with a trusted partner can also help you understand the technical and organizational requirements necessary to implement EPCIS 2.0 successfully. This includes integrating with operational systems and educating all stakeholders on how to use the EPCIS 2.0 solution effectively.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right BizSteps for your business can be a challenging process, as it requires evaluating your supply chain processes and determining your business objectives accurately. However, considering the costs and risks involved can help you choose the BizSteps that best meet your needs while staying within your budget.

Working with a trusted partner can provide invaluable insights and technical expertise to ensure that your EPCIS 2.0 solution is integrated and operates effectively. By following these guidelines, you can choose the right BizSteps for your business and achieve significant improvements in supply chain efficiency, traceability, and compliance while enjoying a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
