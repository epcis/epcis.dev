# A beginner's guide to EPCIS for the supply chain industry

Managing supply chain operations that are globally dispersed is quite a difficult task to accomplish without proper visibility of your material flow. This visibility is directly related to the traceability of products through the supply chain. However, establishing trust through transparency is only possible if there is a globally accepted language implemented across the supply chain. This is where EPCIS comes into play.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services. It is a GS1 standard that provides a standardized way to capture and communicate data across a supply chain. This standard has been created to promote the efficient exchange of EPC (Electronic Product Code) data between trading partners in a supply chain. 

The main idea behind EPCIS is to provide end-to-end visibility of physical objects and events that occur during the supply chain journey right from the manufacturer to the retailer. This allows various supply chain partners to track the movement of products, batch numbers, lot numbers, expiry dates, and other essential information required in handling these products. 

EPCIS consists of four main components - master data, captures, queries, and transformations. These four components work in tandem to create an infrastructure for collecting data, processing it, and accessing it from any location.

## Why is EPCIS important in the supply chain industry?

The supply chain industry is vast and includes multiple parties, such as manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers, and so on. Each of these parties has a different role to play and has their way of handling their end of the supply chain. 

However, due to such diversity in the supply chain, there is a lack of consistency among the various supply chain data systems. This can lead to data silos, which can result in inefficiencies in the supply chain, leading to low visibility and control over the product’s lifecycle. EPCIS aims to address this issue by allowing the collaboration of all partners within the supply chain ecosystem to access the same information when needed. 

Moreover, EPCIS provides a standardized language that not only ensures consistency in the data but also ensures that all the supply chain partners are speaking the same language.

## EPCIS Data Structure

EPCIS uses a standardized structure that is simple and easy to implement, making it perfect for all supply chain partners. The EPCIS data structure comprises five elements: event time, event type, EPCs, read point, and business transaction. These elements are explained below:

### Event Time

The event time refers to the time when the event or transaction took place. This element is a critical piece of data as it allows all the supply chain partners to synchronize their data, regardless of time zones.

### Event Type

The event type indicates the type of event that is being recorded. There may be different types of events captured, such as 'Arrival', 'Departure', 'Read', etc.

### EPCs

EPC (Electronic Product Code) represents a unique identification number, much like a barcode, for a specific product within the supply chain. EPCs can be used to track the product's movement, and they provide a unique identifier that can be traced back to the product’s origins.

### Read Point

The read point represents the location where the EPC event was recorded. It can be a shipping dock or a warehouse, etc.

### Business Transaction

The business transaction refers to the exchange of products or goods between two entities. This element is essential as it enables the supply chain partners to see the transaction and understand its context.

## Implementing EPCIS

Implementing EPCIS involves three stages, namely: Preparation, Modelling, and Implementation.

### Preparation

In the Preparation stage, supply chain partners should identify which EPCIS events should be tracked within their supply chain, and what data should be captured for these events. Once this is determined, the partners can then identify the data sources, such as RFID systems, barcode scanners, and GPS.

### Modelling

In the modeling stage, the partners will create an EPCIS data model that defines the information that needs to be captured and exchanged by the various entities within the supply chain. This includes identifying the data sources and mapping the systems to ensure that there is a clear understanding of what data is required by each of the partners.

### Implementation

In the implementation stage, the partners will use EPCIS data models to implement the tracking and tracing system. Once the system is in place, the partners should then test the system to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

## Advantages of EPCIS

EPCIS provides several advantages for the supply chain industry, some of them are listed below:

### Increased Visibility

EPCIS provides complete end-to-end visibility of the product movement throughout the supply chain. This enables supply chain partners to track their products' lifecycle and be aware of any delays or disruptions.

### Improved Collaboration

EPCIS promotes seamless collaboration between supply chain partners from end-to-end, providing a standardized language for product tracking and sharing information. This not only improves collaboration within the supply chain but can also reduce errors and redundancies in data collection and sharing.

### Better Traceability

EPCIS enables complete traceability of a product's lifecycle, providing real-time updates on product movements and enabling supply chain partners to identify and quickly address any issues that may arise.

## Conclusion

EPCIS represents a significant standardization in the supply chain industry, allowing the communication of product data across various supply chain partners, providing complete visibility into a product's lifecycle, from manufacturer to retailer. Implementing EPCIS in your supply chain can be an essential step in improving your supply chain's visibility, collaboration, and traceability, providing actionable insights into your product's lifecycle.
