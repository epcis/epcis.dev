# Using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV with Big Data Analytics

In the world of supply chain management, visibility is key. But with retailers, manufacturers and logistics companies dealing with an enormous amount of data every day, gaining that visibility can be a challenge. To help with this, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) have been introduced to bring about transparency and build trust. In this blog, we're going to explore how these two technologies work together with big data analytics to create a transformation in the supply chain industry.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is an open standard that has been developed by EPCglobal to enable the sharing of information related to the movement and location of goods across the entire supply chain. It allows the capture of events around the movement of goods and the creation of a shared view of that movement through a common language. This enables real-time visibility of the supply chain, which in turn can help reduce costs and increase efficiency.

EPCIS 2.0 is based on a standard set of messages, known as the CBV, which are used for exchanging data between different parties in the supply chain. This provides a common framework for the sharing of information, which can help build trust and improve collaboration between different stakeholders.

## What is the CBV?

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of messages that define the structure and content of the data that can be shared through EPCIS 2.0. The CBV messages describe events related to the movement of goods, such as when they were shipped, received, or inventoried. The messages also include information about the entities involved in the supply chain, such as manufacturers, retailers, and logistics companies.

The CBV provides a standardized way of exchanging information about events related to the movement of goods, which can help reduce errors and improve collaboration. This helps to build trust between different parties in the supply chain, which is essential for a smooth and efficient supply chain.

## How does Big Data Analytics fit in?

Big data analytics can help to transform the supply chain by providing insights into the movement of goods and identifying areas where cost savings can be made. By using data analytics, supply chain managers can identify patterns and trends in the movement of goods, enabling them to make more informed decisions about how to manage the supply chain.

By using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, big data analytics can be used to analyze the data captured by the system. This can be used to gain insights into the movement of goods, identify areas for improvement, and streamline the supply chain. For example, analytics can be used to identify the most efficient routes for shipping goods, or to identify bottlenecks in the supply chain that are causing delays.

## Benefits of using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV with Big Data Analytics

Using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV with big data analytics can bring significant benefits to the supply chain:

### Real-time visibility

EPCIS 2.0 enables real-time visibility of the supply chain, which can help reduce errors and improve collaboration between different parties in the supply chain. With real-time visibility, supply chain managers can identify potential bottlenecks and take action to prevent delays.

### Improved collaboration

The CBV provides a standardized way of exchanging information about events related to the movement of goods, which can help improve collaboration between different parties in the supply chain. This improves communication and helps to build trust between stakeholders, which is essential for a smooth and efficient supply chain.

### Reduced costs

By using big data analytics to analyze the data captured through EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, supply chain managers can identify areas for improvement and cost savings. This helps to reduce costs and increase efficiency, which ultimately benefits all stakeholders in the supply chain.

### Improved decision making

Through the use of big data analytics, supply chain managers can gain insights into the movement of goods and make more informed decisions about how to manage the supply chain. This can help reduce waste and improve the flow of goods, ultimately resulting in a more efficient supply chain.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the combination of EPCIS 2.0, the CBV and big data analytics can bring significant benefits to the supply chain industry. By providing real-time visibility, improving collaboration, reducing costs and improving decision making, this technology has the potential to transform the supply chain industry. To achieve this transformation, it is essential that supply chain managers and stakeholders embrace these technologies and work together to implement them effectively.
