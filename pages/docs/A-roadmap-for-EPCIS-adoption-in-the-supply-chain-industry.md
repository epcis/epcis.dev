# A roadmap for EPCIS adoption in the supply chain industry

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a globally recognized standard for creating, sharing, and storing supply chain transaction data. It provides a common language for all supply chain stakeholders to communicate effectively and efficiently.

Adopting EPCIS is a crucial step for modern supply chain operations as it enables companies to streamline their business processes, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. In this blog post, we will provide a roadmap for companies that are considering EPCIS adoption.

## Step 1: Identify the key benefits of EPCIS adoption

The first step towards EPCIS adoption is to identify how it can benefit your organization. Some of the key benefits of EPCIS adoption are:

### Improved visibility and traceability

EPCIS provides end-to-end visibility of products and their movement along the supply chain. This allows businesses to track and trace their products from the manufacturer to the end consumer. This visibility enables them to identify and address potential bottlenecks in their supply chain and improve their overall efficiency.

### Enhanced collaboration between supply chain stakeholders

EPCIS enables businesses to share real-time data with their partners across the supply chain. This promotes collaboration and enables all stakeholders to make informed decisions. By enhancing collaboration, EPCIS enables businesses to improve their overall supply chain efficiency.

### Improved compliance and regulatory requirements

EPCIS adoption can help businesses to comply with regulatory requirements such as the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). EPCIS provides a reliable and transparent source of data for regulators to monitor and enforce compliance.

### Reduced operational costs

EPCIS adoption can significantly reduce operational costs by eliminating manual data entry and reducing the need for paper-based documentation. This leads to fewer errors and faster processing times, which can result in cost savings.

## Step 2: Determine your organization's EPCIS readiness

Before embarking on an EPCIS adoption journey, businesses must determine their EPCIS readiness. This involves identifying any existing systems and business processes that can support EPCIS adoption.

For businesses that already have an IT infrastructure in place, EPCIS adoption may be a matter of integrating EPCIS capabilities into their existing systems. However, businesses that lack an IT infrastructure may need to invest in new systems that can support EPCIS adoption.

## Step 3: Define your EPCIS implementation plan

Once your organization has identified the key benefits and determined its EPCIS readiness, the next step is to define your EPCIS implementation plan. This involves defining the scope of the implementation, the timeline, and the budget.

The scope of the implementation should be clearly defined, including which business processes and systems will be impacted by the EPCIS adoption. The timeline should also be clear, with specific milestones and deadlines.

Budget considerations should include the costs of new systems and software, as well as any consultant or training fees that may be necessary.

## Step 4: Select a suitable EPCIS solution

Selecting a suitable EPCIS solution is a critical step in the implementation process. Businesses must consider factors such as cost, functionality, scalability, and ease of integration when selecting an EPCIS solution.

There are several EPCIS solutions available for businesses to choose from, including commercial solutions and open-source solutions. Commercial solutions are typically more expensive but may offer more advanced functionality and support. Open-source solutions, on the other hand, may be more cost-effective but require more technical expertise.

## Step 5: Implement and test the EPCIS solution

Once a suitable EPCIS solution has been selected, the implementation process can begin. This involves configuring the EPCIS solution to match the defined implementation plan and integrating it with existing systems.

Once implemented, the EPCIS solution should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is functioning as expected. This testing should include a variety of scenarios, such as real-time data sharing and traceability.

## Step 6: Undertake employee training and change management

Employee training and change management are critical components of EPCIS adoption. Businesses must ensure that employees are adequately trained on the new systems and processes and understand the benefits of EPCIS adoption.

Change management is also important to ensure a smooth transition to the new systems and processes. This may involve providing adequate support to employees and addressing any concerns or issues that arise during the implementation process.

## Step 7: Monitor, evaluate and continuously improve the EPCIS implementation

The final step in the EPCIS implementation process is to monitor, evaluate, and continuously improve the implementation. This involves regularly reviewing the implementation to identify any areas for improvement or optimization.

Businesses must also monitor their EPCIS implementation to ensure that it continues to provide the expected benefits. This may involve regular reporting and analysis of key metrics such as cost savings, regulatory compliance, and supply chain efficiency.

In conclusion, EPCIS adoption is a crucial step for modern supply chain operations. By following this roadmap, businesses can successfully implement EPCIS and reap the benefits of improved visibility, collaboration, compliance, and cost savings.
