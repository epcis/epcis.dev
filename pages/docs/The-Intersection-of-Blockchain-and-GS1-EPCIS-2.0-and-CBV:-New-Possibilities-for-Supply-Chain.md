# The Intersection of Blockchain and GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV: New Possibilities for Supply Chain

The world is rapidly changing, and supply chain management is no exception. Nowadays, companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of having a transparent and trustworthy supply chain. This is because consumers are now more aware of the impact of their purchasing decisions and want to know that the products they buy are ethically sourced and environmentally friendly.

In order to achieve this level of transparency, many companies are turning to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) standards. These standards were developed by the Global Standards One (GS1) organization and are designed to help organizations track products throughout the supply chain in a standardized way.

In recent years, blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful tool for achieving transparency and trust in supply chain management. The combination of blockchain with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards can open up new possibilities for supply chain management.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standard that specifies a way to share information about products as they move through the supply chain. This standard includes a set of data formats and interface definitions, known as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), that allow different systems and applications to communicate with each other.

The goal of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is to make it easier for companies to track products as they move through the supply chain. This standard ensures that all parties involved in the supply chain have access to the same information about a product, regardless of where it is in the supply chain.

With GS1 EPCIS 2.0, companies can track the movement of a product from the manufacturer to the distributor, to the retailer, and ultimately to the consumer. This level of tracking allows companies to quickly identify and address any issues that arise in the supply chain, such as product recalls or delays.

## What is CBV?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of standardized terms and definitions used to describe products and their attributes. CBV is built on top of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and provides a way for companies to standardize product information across different systems and applications.

The goal of CBV is to make it easier for companies to share product information with each other. With CBV, companies can ensure that they are using the same terminology when describing a product, regardless of who they are talking to.

CBV is particularly useful for companies that use multiple systems or applications to manage their supply chain. By standardizing product information across all these systems, companies can eliminate errors and reduce the risk of miscommunication.

## The Role of Blockchain in Supply Chain Management

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that provides a way to store and share information in a transparent and immutable way. In a blockchain, information is stored in blocks, which are linked together in a chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, along with a timestamp and a set of transactions.

One of the key benefits of blockchain technology is that it provides a high level of transparency and immutability. Because information stored on a blockchain cannot be altered or deleted, it provides a high level of trust in the information that is stored on it.

This level of trust makes blockchain technology particularly useful for supply chain management. By using a blockchain to track products as they move through the supply chain, companies can ensure that all parties involved in the supply chain have access to the same information about a product. This level of transparency can help to eliminate fraud and reduce the risk of product recalls.

## The Benefits of Combining GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with Blockchain

The combination of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with blockchain technology can open up new possibilities for supply chain management. By using blockchain technology to store and share information about products as they move through the supply chain, companies can achieve a new level of transparency and trust.

One of the key benefits of this combination is that it allows for greater interoperability between different systems and applications. By using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to standardize product information, it becomes much easier to share this information across different systems and applications.

This interoperability can help to reduce the risk of errors and miscommunication. For example, if a company uses one system to manage inventory and another system to track shipments, there is a risk of these two systems not being in sync. By using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to standardize product information, it becomes much easier to ensure that all systems and applications are using the same information.

Another benefit of combining GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with blockchain technology is that it provides a high level of security and immutability. Because information stored on a blockchain cannot be altered or deleted, it provides a high level of trust in the information that is stored on it.

This level of trust can help to reduce the risk of fraud and counterfeiting in the supply chain. By using blockchain technology to track products as they move through the supply chain, companies can ensure that all parties involved in the supply chain have access to the same information about a product. This can help to eliminate fraud and reduce the risk of product recalls.

Finally, the combination of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with blockchain technology can help to reduce the cost and complexity of supply chain management. By standardizing product information and using blockchain technology to track products, companies can eliminate the need for multiple systems and applications to manage the supply chain.

This can help to reduce the cost of supply chain management and make it easier for companies to manage their supply chain more effectively.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the combination of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with blockchain technology can open up new possibilities for supply chain management. By using blockchain technology to store and share information about products as they move through the supply chain, companies can achieve a new level of transparency and trust.

This level of transparency can help to reduce the risk of fraud and counterfeiting in the supply chain, as well as reduce the risk of product recalls. In addition, the combination of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with blockchain technology can help to reduce the cost and complexity of supply chain management, making it easier for companies to manage their supply chain more effectively.

Overall, the use of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with blockchain technology represents an exciting new development in the field of supply chain management. As more companies begin to adopt these standards and technologies, we can expect to see new levels of transparency, efficiency, and trust in the supply chain.
