# EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps and Industry Standards for Global Supply Chain Management

The digitization of the global supply chain has been an ongoing trend for many years, as enterprises strive to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve visibility across their operations. One of the foundational technologies for supply chain digitization is EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services), an open standard that enables companies to exchange information about products and their movements across the supply chain. 

However, the original EPCIS standard was limited in its scope and functionality, which led to the development of EPCIS 2.0 to address the shortcomings of the original. Among the improvements introduced in EPCIS 2.0 are the BizSteps specification and support for industry-specific standards, which further enhance the capabilities of EPCIS for global supply chain management.

In this blog post, we’ll take a closer look at the BizSteps specification and industry standards supported by EPCIS 2.0 and their significance for enterprises looking to digitize their supply chain operations.

## Understanding BizSteps

BizSteps is a key feature of the EPCIS 2.0 standard that provides a standardized way to represent business processes in a supply chain. A BizStep is a discrete event in a supply chain process, such as a shipment departure or receipt, that can be captured and shared across the network through EPCIS.

The value of BizSteps is that they provide a common language and structure for representing supply chain events, making it easier for different systems and stakeholders to share and analyze information. For example, a manufacturer can use BizSteps to track the movement of raw materials from suppliers to production facilities, while a retailer can use BizSteps to track inventory levels and sales through various channels.

One of the key benefits of BizSteps is that they enable supply chain partners to collaborate more effectively, even if they are using different systems or processes. By standardizing the representation of supply chain events, businesses can gain a holistic view of their operations and identify areas for improvement or optimization.

## Industry Standards Supported by EPCIS 2.0

In addition to BizSteps, EPCIS 2.0 supports a range of industry-specific standards that enable enterprises to tailor their implementation to their specific needs. These standards include:

### GS1 EPCIS

GS1 is a not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for supply chain management, including EPCIS. GS1 EPCIS is a standard that defines how to capture and share supply chain events using EPCIS. It provides a framework for encoding product data and movement information using the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the Global Location Number (GLN).

GS1 EPCIS is widely used across industries and provides a common language for sharing supply chain events across different systems and stakeholders.

### DSCSA

The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) is a U.S. federal law that requires pharmaceutical companies to implement a traceability system for prescription drugs. DSCSA mandates the use of standardized product identifiers, such as the National Drug Code (NDC), and a uniform system for documenting the movement of drugs across the supply chain.

EPCIS 2.0 supports DSCSA, allowing pharmaceutical companies to leverage the standard to comply with regulatory requirements and improve supply chain visibility.

### GDSN

The Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN) is a network of data pools that enable enterprises to exchange product data with their trading partners. GDSN provides a standardized format for product data, allowing companies to share accurate and up-to-date information about their products.

EPCIS 2.0 supports GDSN, which means that companies can use the standard to share product data and movement information across the supply chain.

### WERC

The Warehousing Education and Research Council (WERC) is a professional association for warehousing and logistics professionals. WERC has developed a set of performance metrics and best practices for warehousing operations, known as the WERC Warehouse Certification Program.

EPCIS 2.0 supports the WERC standards, allowing warehouses to use the standard to track inventory levels, optimize warehouse layouts, and improve labor productivity.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0, with its support for BizSteps and industry standards, provides a robust and flexible platform for enterprises looking to digitize their supply chain operations. BizSteps enable businesses to standardize the representation of supply chain events, making it easier to collaborate and gain insights across different supply chain partners.

Industry-specific standards, such as GS1 EPCIS and DSCSA, further enhance the capabilities of EPCIS 2.0 by providing a common language and framework for sharing information. Whether you’re a pharmaceutical company looking to comply with regulatory requirements or a warehouse looking to optimize operations, EPCIS 2.0 can help you achieve your supply chain digitization goals.
