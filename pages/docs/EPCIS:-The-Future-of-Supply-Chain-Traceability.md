# EPCIS: The Future of Supply Chain Traceability

In today's globalized marketplace, supply chains are getting increasingly complex, involving multiple stakeholders, diverse geographies, and numerous transactions. With this complexity comes the risk of fraud, counterfeiting, and other unethical practices that can compromise the integrity of the supply chain. Fortunately, technologies such as the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) are emerging to address these challenges, enabling real-time visibility, traceability, and accountability across the supply chain.

In this blog post, we will explore what EPCIS is, how it works, and why it is considered the future of supply chain traceability.

## Understanding EPCIS

EPCIS is a global standard developed by GS1, the leading organization for supply chain standards. It is designed to provide a common language and framework for capturing and sharing data about the movement and status of products and assets throughout the supply chain. EPCIS relies on a set of standardized data elements, known as EPCIS events, to capture and communicate information about the "who, what, when, where, why, and how" of supply chain transactions.

EPCIS events include information such as:

- Object ID: The unique identifier of a product or asset, typically encoded in a bar code or RFID tag.
- Object type: The type of product or asset, such as a pallet, case, or individual item.
- Time: The date and time of the event, which may include a timestamp from a sensor or other device.
- Business step: The specific stage of the supply chain process that the event represents, such as "receiving," "shipping," or "transferring ownership."
- Location: The physical location of the event, such as a warehouse, distribution center, or retail store.
- EPCIS action: The type of action that occurred, such as "read," "write," or "observe."

Using these standardized events, EPCIS enables supply chain stakeholders to track and trace the movement and status of products and assets across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished goods. This level of visibility and transparency is critical for enabling effective supply chain management, reducing risk, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## How EPCIS Works

At its core, EPCIS is a set of data standards that enable interoperability between various supply chain systems and applications. EPCIS is designed to be compatible with various data capture technologies, including bar codes, RFID tags, sensors, and other IoT devices. This flexibility enables EPCIS to be used across a wide variety of supply chain contexts, from large-scale global logistics networks to small-scale local operations.

EPCIS data is typically captured at various points in the supply chain process by various systems and devices, including shipping and receiving systems, warehouse management systems, transportation management systems, and point-of-sale systems. This data is then aggregated and harmonized within an EPCIS repository or platform, which serves as a central hub for sharing and accessing supply chain information.

One of the key benefits of EPCIS is its ability to facilitate real-time supply chain visibility and traceability. By capturing and sharing data in near real-time, supply chain stakeholders can monitor and respond to supply chain events as they occur, enabling them to proactively address issues and ensure timely delivery of products and services.

In addition to providing real-time visibility, EPCIS also enables historical analysis of supply chain data. By aggregating and harmonizing data from multiple sources, EPCIS builds a rich data set that can be analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement within the supply chain. This analytical capability is critical for driving continuous improvement and optimizing supply chain performance over time.

## Why EPCIS is the Future of Supply Chain Traceability

EPCIS is widely considered the future of supply chain traceability for several reasons:

### Improved Transparency and Accountability

EPCIS provides greater transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain by capturing and sharing data in real-time. This level of transparency enables supply chain stakeholders to quickly identify and respond to issues such as counterfeiting, theft, and fraud. Additionally, it enables stakeholders to verify compliance with regulatory requirements and other industry standards, reducing the risk of legal or reputational harm.

### Increased Efficiency and Productivity

EPCIS enables greater supply chain efficiency and productivity by providing real-time visibility into supply chain processes. With this visibility, stakeholders can optimize processes and make data-driven decisions that improve operational efficiency and reduce waste. Additionally, EPCIS facilitates collaboration between supply chain partners, enabling more seamless coordination of logistics and other activities.

### Enhanced Customer Experience

EPCIS enhances the customer experience by providing greater visibility into product status and location. This level of visibility enables customers to track their orders and receive timely updates on delivery dates and times. Additionally, EPCIS enables supply chain stakeholders to anticipate and respond to customer needs in a more timely and effective manner.

### Improved Sustainability

EPCIS enables greater sustainability by facilitating more efficient use of resources and reducing waste throughout the supply chain. By providing real-time visibility into supply chain processes, stakeholders can identify and eliminate bottlenecks, optimize logistics, and reduce energy consumption. Additionally, by enabling collaboration between supply chain partners, stakeholders can identify and address sustainability issues throughout the supply chain, from raw materials to end-of-life disposal.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS represents the future of supply chain traceability by providing a standardized, interoperable, and scalable framework for managing supply chain data. With EPCIS, supply chain stakeholders can capture and share information about the "who, what, when, where, why, and how" of supply chain transactions, enabling real-time visibility, traceability, and accountability across the entire supply chain. By implementing EPCIS, supply chain stakeholders can improve transparency, increase efficiency, enhance the customer experience, and promote sustainability throughout the supply chain, ensuring a more secure, reliable, and sustainable global marketplace.
