# A Closer Look at CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 Introduction and Deep Dive

Global trade is essential to our global economy, with companies and industries relying on the seamless interchange of goods across borders to thrive. In the modern business world, maintaining visibility and traceability of goods across the supply chain network is essential for effective and efficient operation. The GS1 EPCIS standard is designed to meet the needs of the modern supply chain industry by providing a standardized format for data exchange and a common language for companies to communicate.

One critical component of the GS1 EPCIS standard is the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), a standardized set of terms and concepts that allow for the exchange of data between trading partners in a consistent and reliable way. In this article, we will take a closer look at CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and explore its importance and benefits.

## Introduction to GS1 EPCIS 2.0

To understand the significance of CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0, we must first have a clear understanding of the GS1 EPCIS standard. GS1 EPCIS is a global standard developed by GS1, a non-profit organization, that enables businesses to share real-time information about the movement and status of goods in the supply chain. The objective of the GS1 EPCIS standard is to provide businesses with a standardized framework for capturing, sharing, and leveraging supply chain event data across the entire supply chain network, including manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers.

The GS1 EPCIS standard is enabled by a set of core concepts, including the Event, which describes a significant occurrence or activity in the supply chain, and the Object, which captures information about the items being tracked or the physical entities involved in the activity. Together, these concepts provide businesses with a standardized framework for describing and communicating supply chain events across the entire network, enabling businesses to leverage the data to optimize supply chain performance.

## What is Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a critical component of the GS1 EPCIS standard. It is a standardized set of terms and concepts that defines common supply chain events and provides a consistent way for businesses to communicate event data. CBV supplies a standardized language that ensures trading partners can accurately interpret and process event data, even if they use different systems or technologies.

CBV enables businesses to communicate data about supply chain events such as receiving, shipping, and inventory keeping, in a consistent and uniform manner that is understandable across all participants in a supply chain. This standardization allows businesses to confidently share data about supply chain event details across systems and applications, enabling them to streamline workflows and optimize their supply chain in real-time.

CBV provides a set of standard terms to describe key supply chain events, which include:

- EPCIS Master Data
- Transformation Events
- Object Events
- Aggregation Events
- Association Events
- Disassociation Events

By defining these terms, CBV enables clear communication and interpretation of supply chain event data, reducing the likelihood of errors or data inconsistencies between trading partners.

## Importance of CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0

CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is vital for businesses that operate in the global supply chain network, as it streamlines communication and helps eliminate critical errors in supply chain events. By providing a standardized language, businesses can communicate information about supply chain events with ease, regardless of the technology used by both trading partners.

Additionally, CBV provides businesses with the necessary tools to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data across supply chains. It allows companies to standardize and structure the data in a reliable, uniform, and transparent approach. This standardized approach simplifies the capturing, sharing, and analyzing of important supply chain data such as:

- Product Traceability
- Inventory Management
- Recalls
- Regulatory Reporting
- Transport Management

Coming to grips with all of the above is not always an easy task, and CBV provides a framework for a clear understanding of a complex process. With CBV, businesses can ensure the accuracy of data that they share, reducing the chances of errors and the need for manual processes to correct them.

Furthermore, CBV plays a critical role in enabling businesses to deploy supply chain visibility without compromising the privacy of their supply chain data. CBV establishes standardized terms and concepts, protecting and shielding businesses from unwanted intrusion.

In summary, CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 facilitates clear and concise communication across the supply chain, ensuring companies can confidently share data while enabling better decision-making, improving operational efficiency while still ensuring data privacy.
