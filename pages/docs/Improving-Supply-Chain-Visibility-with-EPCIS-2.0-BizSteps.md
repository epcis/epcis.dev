# Improving Supply Chain Visibility with EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

In today's globalized market, businesses require real-time visibility into their supply chain to improve productivity, reduce costs, ensure quality, and enhance customer satisfaction. And, with the growing complexity of the supply chain, achieving this visibility is becoming increasingly challenging.

To tackle this challenge, the supply chain industry came up with an open standard called Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS). EPCIS enables the tracking of goods and services through the supply chain by establishing a common language that can be read and understood by all stakeholders.

EPCIS defines a set of events that occur during the supply chain process, and these events are called 'Business Steps' or 'BizSteps.' The adoption of BizSteps helps enable real-time visibility throughout the supply chain and empowers businesses to make informed decisions in real-time.

In this blog post, we'll be discussing how businesses can benefit from the adoption of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps to improve supply chain visibility.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the EPCIS standard. EPCIS 2.0 comes with several new features and improvements to help improve supply chain visibility. EPCIS 2.0 can capture more data than the previous version, which allows businesses to track products more effectively.

EPCIS 2.0 features a new extension called the Business Transaction and Collaboration (BTC) extension. The BTC extension provides additional details about the product, including the owner of the product, the physical location of the product, and the status of the product in the supply chain process. This extension helps businesses understand the flow of products and make informed decisions in real-time.
