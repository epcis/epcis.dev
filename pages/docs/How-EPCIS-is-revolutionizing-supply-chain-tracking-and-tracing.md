# How EPCIS is Revolutionizing Supply Chain Tracking and Tracing

Efficient supply chain management is an essential aspect of modern-day businesses. To achieve this efficiency, tracking and tracing of goods and products circulating in the supply chain is necessary. The recent advancements in technology have provided an innovative solution to the management of the supply chain, EPCIS. In this post, weâ€™ll explore how EPCIS is revolutionizing supply chain tracking and tracing.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services. It is a standard set of specifications used for capturing and sharing events in the supply chain process. This technology has been adopted by manufacturers, logistics, and retailers all over the world to ensure product tracking and tracing.

In the EPCIS system, each product has a unique identifier made up of the Electronic Product Code (EPC), which is assigned to individual items, cases, and pallets. EPCIS captures real-time events on the product such as the location, movement, and status. These events are then recorded in a standardized manner that is universally understandable.

The captured data can be accessed by authorized parties for easy tracking and tracing of the product, thereby improving supply chain efficiency and reducing waste in the system.

## Benefits of EPCIS

### Improved Supply Chain Visibility

EPCIS offers a real-time view of the supply chain, which allows the stakeholders to monitor and track the product as it moves from the manufacturer to the end consumer. This visibility offers more control over the supply chain and makes it easier to detect potential supply chain bottlenecks.

### Increased Efficiency

EPCIS promotes automation in the supply chain process, resulting in reduced manual labor, increasing efficiency, and reducing operational costs. The technology offers a more efficient and faster method of data capture, storage, and retrieval.

### Improved Customer Satisfaction

EPCIS can help companies offer faster delivery, and improved customer engagement by offering real-time tracking data. Customers can rest easy knowing the location of their products as it moves through the supply chain. This tracking capability also enhances product safety and quality.

### Increased Accountability and Transparency

EPCIS offers a transparent record of every activity that is involved in the supply chain. This promotes accountability and increased transparency among the supply chain partners by providing an immutable record of the chain.

## EPCIS Evaluations

EPCIS has gone through various evaluations and certifications over the years to ensure its effectiveness in the supply chain. These evaluations have identified the areas where EPCIS can be used and the barriers that hinder full adoption. Some evaluations include;

### EPCglobal Ratification

EPCglobal ratification is a process that verifies if a system meets the standards set by GS1 organization, which is responsible for the development of the EPCIS standard. Ratification helps ensure that the EPCIS system promotes interoperability via common standards across the supply chain.

### US DoD Certification

The US Department of Defense federally certified EPCIS in 2012, to track movements of military items throughout the supply chain. The certification helped increase the adoption of the EPCIS system, leading to improved supply chain efficiency in the defense sector.

### University of Arkansas Research

At the University of Arkansas, a research team evaluated EPCIS technology in supply chain management. The study proved that EPCIS technology could provide real-time visibility of supply chain dynamics and enhance data accuracy hence increasing supply chain efficiency.

## Industries Using EPCIS

Various industries have integrated EPCIS technology to enhance their supply chain processes.

### Healthcare Industry

The healthcare industry is using EPCIS to track and trace medical products, including drugs, devices, and medical equipment. The track and trace system help enable patient safety by detecting any counterfeit products circulating in the supply chain.

### Retail Industry

The retail industry is also leveraging EPCIS technology to track and trace products from the manufacturer to the end consumer. This use helps provide customers with real-time tracking information and streamline the supply chain process.

### Food and Beverage Industry

The food and beverage industry is using EPCIS to trace their production processes, including the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing, and distribution. The system helps identify the sources of food contamination, thereby improving food safety.

## Future of EPCIS

The adoption of EPCIS technology is growing as businesses worldwide are seeking to enhance their supply chain operations. As the technology evolves, the future of EPCIS is expected to witness further innovations that enhance its functionalities.

Furthermore, advancements in other technologies like blockchain and IoT are expected to play a significant role in the future of EPCIS technology. These other technologies will work alongside EPCIS to reinforce the functionality of the technology.

## Conclusion

With the growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for speed, efficiency, and safety in the supply chain, EPCIS has emerged as a valuable tool for supply chain tracking and tracing. The technology offers improved visibility, accountability, and transparency in the supply chain, leading to increased efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced customer engagement. 

As mentioned earlier, the technology is expected to continue evolving, offering advanced functionalities and stay ahead in meeting the ever-growing demands of the supply chain.
