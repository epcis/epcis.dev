# How EPCIS is Modernizing the Hospitality Industry

In recent years, the hospitality industry has embraced technology in order to improve their operations and provide better customer experiences. One emerging technology that has played a significant role in modernizing the hospitality industry is EPCIS, or Electronic Product Code Information Services.

EPCIS is a standardized method for sharing and communicating supply chain information between different partners in a supply chain. It enables businesses to track and trace individual items or products as they move through the supply chain, from the point of manufacture to the end customer. In this blog post, we will explore how EPCIS is being used in the hospitality industry to improve supply chain visibility and streamline operations.

## Improved Supply Chain Visibility

One of the main benefits of EPCIS for the hospitality industry is increased supply chain visibility. With EPCIS, businesses can track and trace products in real-time, from the point of manufacture to the end customer. This enables them to quickly identify any issues or inefficiencies in the supply chain and take corrective action. For example, if a particular item is taking longer than usual to reach its destination, businesses can quickly identify the cause and take corrective action, such as adjusting shipping routes or changing suppliers.

The increased visibility also allows businesses to better manage their stock levels and ensure that they have the right products in the right place at the right time. This can help to reduce waste and improve margins, as businesses are able to more accurately predict demand and adjust their inventory accordingly.

## Streamlined Operations

In addition to improving supply chain visibility, EPCIS can also help to streamline a business’s operations. By automating the tracking and tracing of products, businesses can reduce the need for manual processes and free up staff time for more value-added activities.

For example, EPCIS can be used to automate the tracking and tracing of food items in a restaurant. By attaching RFID or barcode tags to food items, businesses can automatically track when an item is received, how long it has been stored, and when it is used. This can help to reduce food waste and ensure that customers are always served fresh, high-quality food.

EPCIS can also be used to automate the processing of invoices and other paperwork, reducing the time and cost associated with manual processes. By automating these processes, businesses can reduce errors and improve the accuracy of their financial reporting.

## Enhanced Customer Experience

Finally, EPCIS can help to enhance the customer experience in the hospitality industry. By improving supply chain visibility and streamlining operations, businesses are able to provide a more efficient and reliable service to their customers.

For example, with EPCIS, businesses can quickly identify the source of any quality or safety issues and take corrective action. This can help to reduce the risk of customers becoming ill or having a negative experience.

EPCIS can also be used to provide customers with real-time information about the products they are buying. By scanning a product’s RFID or barcode tag, customers can access information about the product’s origin, manufacturing process, and other relevant information. This information can help to build trust with customers and increase their confidence in the products they are buying.

## Conclusion

EPCIS is a powerful technology that is modernizing the hospitality industry. By improving supply chain visibility, streamlining operations, and enhancing the customer experience, businesses are able to stay competitive and provide better service to their customers. As EPCIS continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more applications in the hospitality industry and other vertical industries.
