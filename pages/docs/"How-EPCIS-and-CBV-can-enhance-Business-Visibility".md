# How EPCIS and CBV Can Enhance Business Visibility

As businesses continue to expand and rely heavily on global supply chains, the need for visibility into these systems becomes critical. Not only does improved visibility reduce operational risks and errors, but it also allows businesses to optimize their processes and improve profitability.

In recent years, two technologies that have emerged as significant facilitators of business visibility are Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). In this post, we'll explore how EPCIS and CBV can enhance business visibility and help companies transform their operations.

## Understanding EPCIS

EPCIS is an open standard for the electronic exchange of information related to supply chain events. Developed by GS1, the global standards organization, EPCIS provides businesses with a way to capture and share data about the movement and location of goods through the supply chain.

At its core, EPCIS allows companies to track and trace goods in realtime through their supply chains, and to collect and analyze data about events such as individual product movements, inventory levels, and changes to delivery schedules.

## The Benefits of EPCIS

The benefits of EPCIS for businesses are many. By providing real-time visibility into the supply chain, EPCIS can help companies to:

### Reduce operational risks

EPCIS enables businesses to monitor their supply chain operations in realtime and identify potential issues before they become major problems. This can help to reduce operational risks and minimize disruptions to the supply chain.

### Improve efficiency

By providing detailed information about the location and movement of goods through the supply chain, EPCIS can help businesses to identify inefficiencies and optimize their processes. This can lead to cost savings and better customer service.

### Enhance collaboration

EPCIS enables companies to share real-time data with partners across the supply chain, including suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers. This can help to improve collaboration and communication, and lead to better supply chain performance overall.

## Understanding CBV

While EPCIS provides a standard for the capture and exchange of data related to supply chain events, Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) provides a standard for the semantics of that data. CBV defines a set of terms and definitions that can be used to describe supply chain events in a consistent and standardized way.

For example, CBV defines terms such as "source", "destination", "shipment", and "inventory", and provides standardized definitions for what these terms mean in the context of supply chain operations.

## The Benefits of CBV

The benefits of CBV for businesses are similar to those of EPCIS. By providing a standardized vocabulary for describing supply chain events, CBV can help companies to:

### Improve data accuracy

By ensuring that everyone in the supply chain is using the same terms and definitions to describe events, CBV can help to improve data accuracy and reduce errors.

### Enhance collaboration

CBV can help to improve collaboration between partners in the supply chain by providing a common vocabulary for describing events. This can lead to better communication and more effective collaboration overall.

### Facilitate interoperability

By providing a standardized vocabulary for describing supply chain events, CBV can help to facilitate interoperability between different systems and platforms. This can make it easier for companies to integrate their supply chain data with other business systems.

## The Power of EPCIS and CBV Together

While EPCIS and CBV are powerful tools on their own, their true power is realized when they are used together. By combining EPCIS and CBV, businesses can ensure that they are capturing and describing supply chain events in a standardized way that can be shared and analyzed in real-time.

For example, using EPCIS with CBV, a company could capture data about a shipment of goods from a supplier, including the origin, destination, and expected delivery date. This data could then be shared in real-time with other partners in the supply chain, who could use that information to optimize their own processes and improve their own operations.

## Conclusion

EPCIS and CBV are powerful tools that can help businesses to improve visibility into their supply chains, reduce operational risks, and optimize their processes. By using these technologies together, companies can capture and share standardized data about supply chain events in real-time, leading to improved collaboration, communication, and performance.

As businesses continue to expand and rely more heavily on global supply chains, the need for enhanced visibility and coordination will only continue to grow. With EPCIS and CBV, companies can rise to meet these challenges and transform their operations for the future.
