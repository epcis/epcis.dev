# EPCIS and CBV: An Introduction to Serialized Data

In the world of supply chain management, it's crucial to have accurate and reliable data about the movement of goods from one place to another. For this reason, many companies rely on Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions, barcodes, RFID, IoT sensors, and other technologies to track their inventory. However, there is an increasing need for a standardized way to store and share this data across different systems and organizations.

Enter the EPCIS and CBV standards. EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, while CBV stands for Core Business Vocabulary. In this article, we'll explore what these standards are, how they work, and why they matter for supply chain management.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a global standard for sharing information about the movement and status of goods in a supply chain. It was developed by the standards organization GS1, and is based on the Electronic Product Code (EPC) â€“ a unique identifier for a physical object or product.

EPCIS allows companies to share information about the location, condition, and status of products as they move through the supply chain. This information can be shared with partners, customers, and regulators to improve visibility and transparency across the supply chain.

At its core, EPCIS is a standardized way to describe events that occur in the supply chain, such as when a product is received, shipped, or sold. These events are known as "EPCIS events," and are represented using a standardized XML format.

## How Does EPCIS Work?

EPCIS works by capturing data at various points in the supply chain and storing it in a centralized database. This database can be accessed by authorized parties to track the movement and status of products.

To understand how EPCIS works, let's take a look at an example. Imagine a company that produces and distributes widgets. The company uses RFID tags to track the location of their widgets as they move through the supply chain.

When a widget is received at a warehouse, an EPCIS event is created that includes information about the location, time, and status of the widget. As the widget is moved to different locations, additional EPCIS events are created to document its movement. When the widget is ultimately sold to a customer, a final EPCIS event is created to document the sale.

All of these EPCIS events are stored in a centralized database, known as an EPCIS repository. Authorized parties can access this repository to track the movement and status of widgets in real-time.

## What is CBV?

CBV, or Core Business Vocabulary, is a set of standardized terms and definitions used to describe data in a supply chain. It was developed by the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), and is designed to be used in conjunction with EPCIS.

CBV provides a common language for describing supply chain data, which can help to reduce ambiguity and improve consistency across different systems and organizations. CBV includes a set of standardized terms for describing parties, products, locations, and events in the supply chain.

## How Do EPCIS and CBV Work Together?

EPCIS and CBV are designed to work together to provide a standardized way to store and share data about the movement of goods in a supply chain. EPCIS provides the framework for capturing and storing this data, while CBV provides a common language for describing it.

When EPCIS events are created, they are described using standardized CBV terms. For example, when a widget is received at a warehouse, the event may include the following CBV terms:

- Party Role (who received the widget)
- Product ID (the unique identifier for the widget)
- Location ID (the location where the widget was received)
- Event Time (the time the widget was received)

By using CBV terms to describe EPCIS events, companies can ensure that their data is consistent and standardized, which can improve the accuracy and reliability of their supply chain data.

## Why Do EPCIS and CBV Matter?

EPCIS and CBV are important standards for supply chain management for several reasons.

First, they provide a standardized way to store and share data about the movement of goods in a supply chain. This can help to improve visibility and transparency across the supply chain, which can lead to more efficient operations and better decision-making.

Second, EPCIS and CBV can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of supply chain data. By using a common language to describe events, companies can reduce ambiguity and ensure that their data is consistent across different systems and organizations.

Finally, EPCIS and CBV can help to reduce the costs and complexity of supply chain management. By providing a standardized approach to data management, companies can more easily integrate their systems with those of their partners and customers, which can lead to more efficient and streamlined operations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS and CBV are important standards for the modern supply chain. They provide a standardized way to store and share data about the movement of goods, which can improve visibility, accuracy, and efficiency across the supply chain.

As supply chains become more complex and global, the need for standardized data management will only become more important. By embracing standards like EPCIS and CBV, companies can stay ahead of the curve and ensure that they are well-positioned for success in the years to come.
