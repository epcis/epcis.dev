# A Beginner's Guide to EPCIS and CBV for Business Transformation

The use of technology in supply chain management is no longer a choice for businesses of any industry or size. Among the innovative supply chain technology solutions that have transformed mission-critical processes across industry verticals, Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) have been gaining more and more recognition. 

In this beginner's guide to EPCIS and CBV, we will explore the basic concepts of both the technologies, how they work together, and the business transformation benefits they bring to supply chain processes.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is an XML-based standard data format that captures data and events in the lifecycle of a product or asset in the supply chain, from manufacturing to warehousing and distribution. It provides a standardized information exchange interface between different trading partners operating in various supply chain contexts.

EPCIS operates on the principles of capturing, managing, and sharing events and data from the life of a product, such as its origin, product type, batch number or serial number, shipping, receiving, and disposition stages, and other relevant metadata. EPCIS makes this information accessible to the parties involved in the supply chain in real-time, via a standardized interface.

EPCIS enables businesses to track inventory levels, enhance product traceability, and maintain compliance with various regulatory requirements, such as serialization laws, recall management, and anti-counterfeiting measures.

## What is CBV?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a code list of unique identifiers for individual entities or attributes in the supply chain that are standardized across all trading partners. These include identifying codes, units of measure, and other relevant parameters that describe a product or transport, such as item code, transaction ID, or location code.

CBV ensures that all parties in the supply chain use the same language in describing objects or events, thus eliminating any possible ambiguity, misinterpretation or inconsistent data exchange. CBV is an essential component of EPCIS as it provides the underlying structure for categorizing and tagging the data that EPCIS captures.

With CBV as the standard, businesses can integrate their supply chain data with applications more efficiently, facilitate analytics and reporting, and improve overall process transparency.

## How EPCIS and CBV work together

EPCIS and CBV work in tandem to provide a comprehensive, standardized, and real-time view of the entire supply chain process. Every data event captured by EPCIS is tagged with the corresponding CBV identifier, and through CBV, the event becomes semantically consistent with data from different business units and trading partners.

For example, if an RFID tag attached to a container reports that the container's temperature has exceeded a certain level during shipping, EPCIS captures the data (event) and associates it with the relevant CBV identifier (e.g., transport ID). The information is shared with all trading partners connected to the supply chain, providing a transparent view of the incident, and enabling timely escalation and proactive management.

EPCIS and CBV facilitate the automated sharing of data between supply chain partners, which reduces the manual effort required in reconciling data, reduces errors, and enables faster decision-making.

## The Business Transformation benefits of EPCIS and CBV

Business transformation is often a journey that involves a radical shift in the way a company operates, and adopting EPCIS and CBV can significantly contribute to this transformation. By introducing these technologies in their supply chain management processes, businesses can enjoy several transformational benefits, such as:

### Improved Data Management

EPCIS and CBV allow businesses to capture and manage data on products or assets throughout their lifecycle. This detailed level of information allows companies to make more informed decisions about their supply chain processes, predict future trends and adjust their logistics to capitalize on these insights.

### Increased Efficiency

By providing a standardized interface and language for data sharing in the supply chain, EPCIS and CBV minimize the complexity of integrating and reconciling data from various sources. This automation reduces the time needed to complete supply chain-related tasks, resulting in faster turnaround times, lower operational costs, and a more agile supply chain.

### Better Operational Visibility

EPCIS and CBV enable visibility into every aspect of the supply chain, providing real-time insights into the current status of products and assets. This visibility reduces the likelihood of transit delays, stock-outs, or inventory pile-ups, as the companies can identify potential issues before they become problems.

### Enhanced Regulatory Compliance

EPCIS and CBV support compliance with regulatory requirements related to product traceability, recall management, and anti-counterfeiting. Standardized data exchange through EPCIS ensures all relevant parties have the required information at their fingertips, allowing for faster and more accurate compliance reporting.

## Conclusion

EPCIS and CBV are technologies that hold great potential for businesses looking to digitally transform their supply chain management. By providing a standardized and transparent data exchange interface, these technologies enable real-time visibility, efficiency, better decision-making, and improved regulatory compliance.

Incorporating these technologies requires collaboration with other partners along the supply chain, including manufacturers, logistics providers, and retailers, along with a commitment to standardize data exchange.

As businesses implement EPCIS and CBV, they must invest in the right talent and tools to get the maximum benefits of these technologies. No matter where a business is in their supply chain transformation journey, EPCIS, and CBV can play a vital role in transforming their supply chain's performance, enabling them to stay ahead of the competition.
