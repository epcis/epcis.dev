# EPCIS in the Aerospace Industry: Making Production Processes Efficient

The aerospace industry is one of the most complex and technologically advanced industries in the world. With the increasing demand for air travel and the growing importance of efficient manufacturing processes, it is important for aerospace companies to implement technology that can enhance their production workflows. One such technology that has been gaining prominence in the aerospace industry is the EPCIS system.

EPCIS, or Electronic Product Code Information Services, is a standard developed by GS1 to share supply chain data in real-time. It is an open standard that allows different supply chain partners to share information about product movements such as their manufacturing, shipment, and delivery. The EPCIS standard provides a unified data model and a set of interfaces to connect disparate systems and applications.

In the aerospace industry, EPCIS offers many benefits to manufacturers, suppliers, and customers alike. In this blog post, we will explore how EPCIS can make aerospace production processes more efficient and ultimately improve the overall industry’s performance.

## Benefits of EPCIS in Aerospace Manufacturing

### 1. Real-time Visibility

The aerospace industry comprises numerous stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers. EPCIS enables real-time visibility of product movements across the supply chain, enabling companies to track their products from production to delivery. By being able to monitor products in real-time, aerospace companies can make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall performance of the industry.

### 2. Improved Traceability

Aerospace manufacturing involves large, complex machinery and intricate parts that require high precision. Defective parts can cause significant delays or even accidents during flights. EPCIS comes in handy in monitoring production processes, including the assembly of intricate parts. The system provides traceability information that helps identify the root cause of defects in case of product recalls, reducing the likelihood of accidents.

### 3. Enhanced Collaboration 

The aerospace industry involves multiple stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers. EPCIS enhances collaboration between these parties by providing real-time access to shared data. Suppliers can share product data with manufacturers, who can in turn track and monitor the products throughout the manufacturing process. Logistics providers can also provide updated shipment information, enabling customers to track their products in real-time.

### 4. Increased Efficiency in Supply Chain

Aerospace manufacturing involves complex supply chain logistics, such as sourcing raw materials, coordinating production schedules, and delivering finished products to customers. EPCIS streamlines supply chain logistics by providing real-time data that enables companies to make faster decisions. This helps manufacturers manage inventory levels better and optimize production schedules. Moreover, reduced delivery times enhance customer satisfaction, leading to repeat business and positive customer reviews.

### 5. Improved Compliance Management

Aerospace products are subject to numerous safety regulations and industry standards. The EPCIS system provides real-time tracking of products, enabling aerospace manufacturers to monitor compliance requirements throughout the supply chain automatically. This helps manufacturers manage compliance-related risks better while also ensuring products are delivered safely and accurately.

## Implementing EPCIS in the Aerospace Industry 

Implementing the EPCIS system in aerospace manufacturing processes requires careful planning, and coordination between supply chain partners. The following steps can be taken to ensure successful implementation:

### 1. Develop a Comprehensive EPCIS Strategy

Develop a comprehensive strategy for implementing EPCIS into the organization’s production processes. It should consider the entire organizational design, including identifying stakeholders, process integration, and identifying data to be tracked.

### 2. Identify and Choose Partners

Identify and choose supply chain partners that can support EPCIS. The aerospace industry comprises numerous players, so identifying partners that support the same technology is essential. This helps in streamlining processes and makes sharing of real-time data easier.

### 3. Integrate EPCIS Systems

Integrate the EPCIS system with existing systems and applications by identifying the relevant data to be shared. This involves identifying the different data elements and mapping them to EPCIS fields. This also includes testing and validating the system before launching it.

### 4. Train Employees 

Train employees on the use of EPCIS systems and how to leverage the data collected through the system. This includes redefining process flows and redefining roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability.

### 5. Continuous Improvement

Continuously monitor EPCIS system performance and results. This includes monitoring data accuracy, system performance, and feedback from employees and stakeholders. Make the necessary adjustments to ensure maximum efficiency in production processes.

## Conclusion

The aerospace industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and manufacturers need to implement technology that can enhance their performance. The EPCIS system provides a unified data model and a set of interfaces that enables supply chain partners to share real-time information about product movements. Implementing EPCIS in aerospace manufacturing processes can enhance collaboration, improve supply chain efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and ensure regulatory compliance. By following the recommended steps, aerospace manufacturers can take full advantage of EPCIS, paving the way for improved performance and competitiveness in the industry.
