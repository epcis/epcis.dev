# Understanding the Importance of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management is a vast and ever-changing field that requires concerted efforts from stakeholders at every stage of the supply chain to make it effective. The supply chain management process involves various activities such as sourcing, logistics, inventory management, production, and distribution. To create a one-stop solution for efficient supply chain management, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV play a vital role.

In this blog post, we will dive deep into the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, their significance in supply chain management, and their integration into today's technological advancements.

## GS1 EPCIS 2.0

GS1 is a non-profit organization that offers globally recognized barcoding standards, including unique identification of products, locations, and assets. The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a global standard developed and managed by GS1 that provides end-to-end visibility in the supply chain.

EPCIS enables organizations to create, share, and receive real-time events, supply chain reports, and operational insights on a global network, ensuring smooth and efficient supply chain management. For example, if a retailer wants to know the location and status of their product at any given time, they can track its journey through the supply chain using EPCIS.

EPCIS operates on a unique identifier - the Electronic Product Code (EPC) - assigned to every unit of product or asset being tracked. It allows data to be exchanged across the supply chain network that leads to increased efficiency, better decision-making and reduced operational costs.

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version that offers significant enhancements in terms of performance, scalability, flexibility, and support for a broader range of data management needs.

### Benefits of GS1 EPCIS 2.0

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 provides many benefits to the supply chain actors. Below are some of the key advantages that make EPCIS a game-changer in supply chain management.

#### Improved Visibility

EPCIS provides accurate, real-time data that helps businesses make better decisions. Companies that adopt EPCIS can track every movement and event in their supply chain â€“ from raw materials to finished products. This information helps managers identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks, allowing them to make informed improvements to their supply chains.

#### Enhanced Collaboration

Sharing data across the supply chain is a challenge, especially when there are multiple systems and platforms in use. EPCIS allows supply chain partners to share data seamlessly in real-time, enhance collaboration and, by extension, collaboration to create value for the entire supply chain.

#### Compliance with Industry Regulations

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 helps companies comply with industry regulations such as track and trace and serialization requirements. By using EPCIS, companies can ensure that supply chain events, shipping statuses, and recalls are managed efficiently and compliant with regulatory standards.

#### Cost Savings

EPCIS streamlines supply chain processes and reduces the risk of errors and delays. With better visibility, companies can optimize their supply chain networks, allowing them to maximize cost savings and work more efficiently.

## CBV

CBV is an acronym for Core Business Vocabulary, which is a set of standardized codes that allow trading partners to communicate business transactions accurately. CBV classifies different types of transactions such as orders, invoices, and payments into a universal vocabulary that all supply chain partners can understand.

In the past, companies used their own proprietary codes for business transactions. As a result, data exchange and analysis across systems and companies became challenging. CBV eliminates the need for manual mapping between proprietary codes and standard codes, saving time and improving accuracy.

### Benefits of CBV

CBV provides many advantages to supply chain actors, including:

#### Standardization

CBV uses global standards to classify transactions, ensuring messages are interpreted uniformly across the supply chain. This ensures consistency and interoperability between trading partners.

#### Reduced Errors

Using standardized codes reduces the likelihood of manual errors caused by the mapping of proprietary codes to standard codes, ensuring that messages are communicated accurately from one trading partner to another.

#### Fast Implementation

CBV is simple to implement, reducing the cost and time of adoption. CBV is widely available and can be integrated into existing systems and platforms.

## Integration of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are complementary technologies that help supply chains operate effectively. By combining the two, companies can gain increased visibility and traceability across the supply chain.

EPCIS and CBV can eliminate the need for proprietary codes and mappings that cause supply chain inefficiencies, enabling seamless communication between systems and partners. The result is a more efficient and transparent supply chain, resulting in increased productivity and customer satisfaction.

### Use Cases

Below are some of the use cases that demonstrate the integration of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in supply chain management:

#### Pharmaceutical Industry

The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated and requires accurate tracking of product movements through the supply chain. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV integration will allow the tracking of the product through the supply chain, from the manufacturer to the end consumer, while simultaneously ensuring the product is within regulatory requirements.

#### Food Industry

The food industry is another sector that benefits significantly from the integration of EPCIS and CBV. In the United States, the FDA requires that fresh fruit and vegetables be traceable. When seeking to comply with the regulation, the Whole Foods Market in the US implemented a traceability solution using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to track the location of their produce from farm to store.

#### Retail Industry

The retail industry is all about customer satisfaction, and providing accurate tracking information to consumers is essential. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV enable retailers to provide up-to-date tracking information on shipments, making the customer experience more satisfactory.

## Conclusion

In essence, GS1 EPCIS 2.0, and CBV form part of a suite of technological solutions geared towards a more transparent, efficient, and collaborative supply chain. The benefits of these technologies are many while the integration of both is a game-changer for businesses that embrace digitization.

The more businesses adopt GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, the more we should expect the supply chain management process to improve. In the future, we can expect further enhancements in terms of reducing human intervention, automation, and machine learning. As we move forward, the crucial role played by GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in creating a successful future for the supply chains can't be overemphasized.
