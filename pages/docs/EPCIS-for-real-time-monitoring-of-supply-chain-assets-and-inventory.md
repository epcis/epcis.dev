# EPCIS for Real-Time Monitoring of Supply Chain Assets and Inventory

The ability to track and monitor assets and inventory in real time is a critical need for many businesses in the supply chain industry. Enterprise and supply chain systems generate large amounts of data that can provide valuable insights regarding inventory management and asset utilization. However, this data is often siloed within disparate systems, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive view of supply chain operations.

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard was developed to address these challenges by providing a universal framework for capturing and sharing supply chain data. EPCIS is designed to support real-time tracking and monitoring of supply chain assets and inventory, enabling businesses to make more informed decisions and improve operational efficiency.

In this blog post, we will discuss the key features of EPCIS, how it can be used for real-time monitoring of supply chain assets and inventory, and the benefits it can provide for businesses.

## Key Features of EPCIS

EPCIS is an open standard that can be used by any business or organization involved in the supply chain. The standard defines a common language and data model for capturing and sharing information about supply chain events, such as the movement of goods, inventory levels, and asset utilization.

EPCIS provides a number of key features that make it ideal for real-time monitoring of supply chain assets and inventory, including:

### Event-driven Architecture

EPCIS is designed to capture data at the individual event level, rather than at a summary or aggregate level. This allows businesses to more accurately track and monitor supply chain events, such as the movement of goods or the use of a particular asset. By capturing this level of detail, businesses can gain a more granular understanding of their supply chain operations and make more informed decisions.

### Standardized Data Model

EPCIS defines a standardized data model for describing supply chain events. This ensures that data is consistent across different systems and organizations, making it easier to share information and gain insights into supply chain operations.

### Interoperability

EPCIS is designed to be interoperable with other supply chain systems and standards. This means that businesses can integrate EPCIS with their existing systems and processes, and share data with partners and customers who use different systems.

### Real-time Monitoring

EPCIS supports real-time monitoring of supply chain events. By capturing and sharing data in real time, businesses can respond quickly to changes in inventory levels or asset utilization, and make adjustments to their operations as needed.

## Using EPCIS for Real-Time Monitoring

One of the key use cases for EPCIS is real-time monitoring of supply chain assets and inventory. By capturing and sharing data in real time, businesses can gain a comprehensive view of their operations and make more informed decisions about inventory management, asset utilization, and other aspects of their supply chain.

Here are some of the ways that businesses can use EPCIS for real-time monitoring:

### Inventory Management

EPCIS can be used to track inventory levels in real time. By capturing data on the movement of goods within a supply chain, businesses can gain insights into inventory levels, identify potential bottlenecks or delays, and make adjustments to their operations as needed.

For example, a business could use EPCIS to monitor the movement of goods from a warehouse to a retail store. By tracking the location of each item in real time, the business could gain a more accurate understanding of inventory levels and identify areas where adjustments may be needed.

### Asset Utilization

EPCIS can also be used to track the utilization of supply chain assets, such as trucks, machinery, and other equipment. By capturing data on asset usage in real time, businesses can identify opportunities to improve asset efficiency, minimize downtime, and reduce costs.

For example, a business could use EPCIS to track the usage of a particular piece of machinery within their supply chain. By monitoring usage patterns and identifying areas where the machine is not being used efficiently, the business could make adjustments to their operations and improve overall asset utilization.

### Supply Chain Optimization

Finally, EPCIS can be used to optimize the supply chain as a whole. By capturing data on supply chain events in real time, businesses can identify areas where there is room for improvement, such as delays in transportation or bottlenecks in inventory management.

For example, a business could use EPCIS to track the movement of goods from their suppliers to their warehouse, and then to their retail stores. By monitoring each step of the supply chain in real time, the business could identify areas where delays are occurring and make adjustments to their operations to optimize the supply chain.

## Benefits of Using EPCIS for Real-Time Monitoring

There are a number of benefits to using EPCIS for real-time monitoring of supply chain assets and inventory. Some of the key benefits include:

### Improved Operational Efficiency

By capturing and sharing data in real time, businesses can identify areas where they can improve operational efficiency. This can lead to faster delivery times, reduced costs, and increased customer satisfaction.

### Better Inventory Management

EPCIS can provide businesses with a more accurate view of inventory levels and movement, enabling them to make more informed decisions about inventory management. This can help businesses to minimize waste, improve supply chain resilience, and reduce the need for emergency orders.

### Increased Asset Utilization

By tracking the utilization of assets in real time, businesses can identify areas where they can improve efficiency and reduce downtime. This can lead to increased productivity, reduced costs, and improved asset utilization.

### Improved Supply Chain Resilience

EPCIS can help businesses to identify potential bottlenecks or delays within their supply chain, enabling them to make adjustments to their operations as needed. This can help to improve supply chain resilience and reduce the risk of disruptions.

## Conclusion

EPCIS provides a universal framework for capturing and sharing supply chain data, enabling businesses to track and monitor assets and inventory in real time. By using EPCIS for real-time monitoring, businesses can gain a comprehensive view of their operations, make more informed decisions, and improve operational efficiency.

The benefits of using EPCIS for real-time monitoring include improved operational efficiency, better inventory management, increased asset utilization, and improved supply chain resilience. As such, businesses in the supply chain industry should consider adopting EPCIS as a key tool for managing their operations and improving their competitive position in the market.
