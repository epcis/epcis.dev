# How EPCIS and CBV Improve Supply Chain Resilience

In the world of supply chain management, it's critical to have the ability to track products from their origins to their final destinations. This is especially important in today's marketplace, where consumer demands for transparency and sustainability have become increasingly important factors in purchasing decisions.

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) are two technologies that can help improve supply chain resilience by enabling more effective and efficient tracking of products throughout the entire supply chain.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard that provides a common language for describing the movement and status of products across the supply chain. It enables manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and other stakeholders to share information about the location, time, and condition of specific items in real-time.

EPCIS uses a standardized framework to collect and share data related to products, including their unique identifiers, serial numbers, barcode data, and more. By doing so, it helps to bridge the information gap between different organizations involved in the supply chain and provides better visibility into the movement of products.

## What is CBV?

CBV is a standard vocabulary that provides a shared language for describing business processes and activities. It enables different stakeholders in the supply chain to communicate more effectively and efficiently by ensuring that everyone is using the same terminology.

CBV covers a wide range of business activities, including logistics, transportation, manufacturing, and more. It provides a clear and concise way of describing these activities, which helps to reduce confusion and increase accuracy in communications.

## How EPCIS and CBV Improve Supply Chain Resilience

EPCIS and CBV can be used together to create a more resilient and efficient supply chain. Here are some ways in which they can help:

### Increased Visibility

One of the biggest benefits of EPCIS and CBV is increased visibility into the movement of products throughout the supply chain. By using a common language and standardized framework, all stakeholders can have access to real-time information about the location, time, condition, and other important details of specific products. This visibility can help to reduce the risk of lost or stolen goods and ensure that products are delivered to their intended recipients in a timely and efficient manner.

### Better Collaboration

EPCIS and CBV can also help to improve collaboration between different organizations involved in the supply chain. By using a shared vocabulary and standardized framework, stakeholders can communicate more effectively and efficiently, which can reduce confusion and errors. This can lead to faster response times and improved decision-making, which can ultimately improve the overall performance of the supply chain.

### Improved Efficiency

Another benefit of EPCIS and CBV is improved efficiency. By using a standardized framework, stakeholders can automate many of the processes involved in tracking products, which can save time and reduce costs. For example, RFID and IoT sensors can be used to automatically track the movement of products throughout the supply chain, which can reduce the need for manual intervention and improve accuracy.

### Increased Resilience

Finally, EPCIS and CBV can help to increase the resilience of the supply chain. By providing more visibility, better collaboration, and improved efficiency, stakeholders can respond more quickly and effectively to disruptions and changes in the market. This can help to ensure that products are delivered on time and in the right condition, even in the face of unexpected disruptions or challenges.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS and CBV are powerful technologies that can help improve the resilience of the supply chain. By providing greater visibility, better collaboration, improved efficiency, and increased resilience, they can help to ensure that products are delivered to their intended recipients in a timely and efficient manner. As the demand for transparency and sustainability continues to grow, EPCIS and CBV will become increasingly important tools for supply chain stakeholders who seek to create more resilient and sustainable supply chains that can adapt to changing market conditions.
