# Establishing Trust in Data with EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

The rise of digital transformation has allowed for industries to become more efficient and effective in processing and analyzing data. However, with the influx of data comes the issue of trust. Inaccurate or false data can lead to disastrous outcomes in many industries, such as healthcare, supply chain management, and food safety. This is where the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) come in to help establish trust in data.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is an open-source data standard that is used to track and trace products across supply chains. Developed by GS1, a global standards organization, EPCIS 2.0 provides a way for businesses to share information about products and their movements in a standardized way.

This information is stored in a decentralized and distributed system, which allows for the data to be authenticated and accessible to multiple parties. EPCIS 2.0 includes functionalities such as event capturing, event querying, and event subscription, which are critical components for establishing trust in data.

## What is the CBV?

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is an extension to EPCIS 2.0 that aims to standardize and define commonly used terms and concepts within the world of supply chains. Developed by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), the CBV provides a shared understanding of data and eliminates ambiguity in data exchanges.

By using the CBV, businesses can ensure that their data is interpreted uniformly and accurately by all parties involved in the supply chain. This creates a foundation of trust and transparency that is necessary for efficient and effective supply chain management.

## Establishing Trust with EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

The combination of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV creates an environment where trust can be established and maintained throughout the entire supply chain. This is accomplished through the following mechanisms:

### 1. Data Authentication

EPCIS 2.0 allows for the authentication of data through the use of digital signatures. When data is added to the system, it is signed with a digital signature which can be verified by anyone with access to the data.

This ensures that the data has not been tampered with or altered in any way. By using digital signatures, businesses can be confident that the data they are receiving and sharing is accurate and trustworthy.

### 2. Data Synchronization

One of the biggest issues with supply chain management is the lack of visibility into the movement of goods. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV allow for the synchronization of data between all parties involved in the supply chain.

This means that everyone involved has access to the same information about the products being shipped, their location, and their status. By having this level of visibility, businesses can make more informed decisions, which ultimately leads to a more efficient and effective supply chain.

### 3. Consistent Data Interpretation

The CBV provides a common language that eliminates ambiguity in data exchanges. By ensuring that everyone involved in the supply chain is interpreting the data in the same way, businesses can establish a foundation of trust and transparency.

This is critical in situations where decisions are being made based on the data. By having a shared understanding of the data, everyone involved can be confident that the decisions being made are based on accurate and trustworthy information.

### 4. Real-Time Visibility

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV allow for real-time visibility into the movement of goods. This means that businesses can track their products in real-time, which reduces the risk of lost or stolen goods.

Real-time visibility also enables businesses to optimize their supply chain by identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the process. By making data-driven decisions, businesses can reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profits.

## Conclusion

Establishing trust in data is critical in any industry that relies on the movement of goods. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide a solid foundation for businesses to achieve this trust by enabling data authentication, data synchronization, consistent data interpretation, and real-time visibility.

By using these tools, businesses can make more informed decisions, reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profits. In today's fast-paced and competitive business environment, having the ability to establish and maintain trust in data is essential for success.
