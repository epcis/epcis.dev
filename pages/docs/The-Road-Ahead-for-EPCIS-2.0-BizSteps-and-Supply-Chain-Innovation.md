# The Road Ahead for EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps and Supply Chain Innovation

Since the introduction of Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0, the supply chain industry has seen a significant improvement in supply chain visibility and transparency. This technology is designed to provide better tracking of products and goods throughout their lifecycle, ensuring that all parties involved have access to accurate and real-time information.

One of the most exciting aspects of EPCIS 2.0 is its BizSteps functionality. BizSteps allow for a standardized way of capturing and sharing data related to business transactions, which is especially useful in complex supply chain environments. In this blog post, we will delve into the importance of BizSteps and the potential benefits they can bring to the supply chain innovation.

## The Importance of BizSteps

BizSteps provide a standardized way to capture and share data related to business transactions. This means that regardless of the type of product, service or transaction, organizations can easily capture and share accurate and consistent data that represents the key steps in the supply-chain workflow.

In many supply chain processes, each step is unique and has its own specific data requirements. This often leads to organizations developing their own proprietary data formats and systems to capture and share this data. BizSteps solves this issue by providing a standardized way to capture and share data, which ensures that information is easily accessible and consistent across organizations, leading to greater supply chain visibility and coordination.

## The Benefits of Using BizSteps

One of the most significant benefits of using BizSteps is the potential to improve supply chain visibility and coordination, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings. By standardizing data capture and sharing, organizations can quickly and easily access key supply chain information, reducing the time and effort required to manually input and gather data.

BizSteps also help companies to better manage risk by providing a comprehensive view of potential risks at each step of the supply chain. This enables organizations to identify any potential bottlenecks, delays or other issues that may arise, and take proactive steps to resolve them.

In addition, using BizSteps can also help to improve customer and partner relations. By providing real-time information on product status and delivery times, organizations can better manage customer expectations, leading to improved satisfaction.

## The Future of Supply Chain Innovation with BizSteps

With the increasing importance of supply chain efficiency and transparency, BizSteps will likely play a significant role in shaping the future of supply chain innovation. As more organizations adopt EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps, there will be a greater standardization of supply chain data capture and sharing, ultimately leading to greater efficiency, transparency and collaboration.

One area where BizSteps could have a significant impact is in the area of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is becoming increasingly important in many industries, including the supply chain. By providing a standardized way to capture and share data, BizSteps can help to facilitate the adoption of blockchain technology, which could lead to even greater supply chain transparency and security.

Another area of opportunity is in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). As AI becomes more prevalent in the supply chain industry, the ability to capture and share accurate and consistent data will become even more important. BizSteps provide the foundation for this, enabling organizations to capture the data required for AI systems to function effectively.

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, BizSteps represent an important development in the ongoing evolution of EPCIS 2.0 and supply chain innovation. By providing a standardized way to capture and share data, BizSteps can help to improve supply chain efficiency, transparency and collaboration. As more organizations adopt EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps, there will be even greater opportunities for innovation and growth in the supply chain industry.
