# A Primer on EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps and Their Role in Industry-Specific Applications

The EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) 2.0 standard has been developed specifically for enabling the exchange of data on products and their movements through various stages of the supply chain. It provides a common language and framework for organizations to share information about products and their statuses in real-time, across diverse technologies and platforms. 

One of the key elements of EPCIS 2.0 is the inclusion of BizSteps. This concept refers to the various business steps or activities that occur during the lifecycle of a product, from its production to its consumption. In this blog post, we will explore the role of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 and their significance in industry-specific applications. 

## Understanding BizSteps 

The BizSteps framework comprises of a set of events or activities that occur during the course of a productâ€™s lifecycle. These events may include manufacturing, packaging, shipping, receiving, storing, and selling, among others. BizSteps serve as a common language for different organizations to share data and communicate with one another about various activities related to a product.

Each BizStep has specific characteristics, such as a name, identifier, description, time, and location. These characteristics help to identify the event, track its progress, and provide context to the data being shared. Additionally, multiple BizSteps can be used to define a complete process or workflow, with each step serving as a milestone in the process.

## Advantages of using BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 

The use of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 provides several advantages over traditional methods of data exchange. These include:

### Standardization 

By defining a common language for describing and tracking product-related activities, BizSteps facilitate the exchange of information across different organizations, systems, and platforms. This promotes standardization and ensures that data is consistent, accurate, and reliable.

### Real-time visibility 

Since BizSteps provide real-time data on product activities, they enable organizations to track products more effectively across the supply chain. This allows for better visibility into the movement and status of products, which can help to improve decision-making and reduce inefficiencies.

### Improved collaboration 

By allowing organizations to share data on product activities in a standardized format, BizSteps promote collaboration and enhance communication between different stakeholders, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. This can lead to improved coordination, faster response times, and better outcomes for all parties involved.

## Industry-specific applications of BizSteps 

The use of BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0 has several industry-specific applications, some of which are highlighted below:

### Pharmaceutical supply chain 

In the pharmaceutical industry, the tracking and management of product activities is critical for ensuring patient safety and regulatory compliance. By using BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, pharmaceutical companies can track products from production to dispensation, ensuring that they are stored and transported in appropriate conditions and are not counterfeited or diverted. This can enhance patient safety and security while also minimizing the risk of regulatory violations.

### Retail inventory management 

In the retail industry, managing inventory levels and ensuring product availability is critical for ensuring customer satisfaction and maximizing sales. By using BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, retailers can track their inventory levels in real-time, monitor product movement and velocity, and optimize their supply chain operations accordingly. This can lead to improved inventory management, reduced stockouts, and higher customer satisfaction.

### Food safety 

In the food industry, ensuring the safety and quality of products is essential for protecting public health and avoiding costly recalls. By using BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0, food producers, processors, and distributors can track product activities from farm to table, ensuring that they are stored, transported, and sold under appropriate conditions. This can enhance food safety and security while also minimizing the risk of foodborne illnesses.

## Conclusion 

BizSteps are a critical component of EPCIS 2.0, offering a standardized framework for tracking and sharing data on product activities across diverse systems and platforms. By using BizSteps, organizations can improve collaboration, real-time visibility, and standardization, while also enabling industry-specific applications in areas such as pharmaceuticals, retail, and food safety. As the use of EPCIS 2.0 continues to grow, BizSteps are poised to play an increasingly important role in enabling data-driven decision-making and enhancing supply chain efficiency and effectiveness.
