# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV in the Context of Industry 4.0

The Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0 is the name given to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It is the fusion of physical and digital systems and the internet of things (IoT) leading to cyber-physical systems. As the manufacturing industry shifts towards Industry 4.0, the supply chain is becoming increasingly complex leading to greater need for interoperability and information exchange. Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) are key standards that can help address these needs.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is an extension to the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard developed by GS1, a not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for business communication. EPCIS 2.0 defines a standardized way of sharing information about supply chain events among different organizations. EPCIS 2.0 also provides a standardized way of describing and exchanging location, time, and other data related to supply chain events.

## What is CBV?

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a standardized vocabulary developed by GS1 that allows for the consistent description of business processes and activities. The CBV provides a set of standardized terms and definitions that enable business partners to share information and understand one another's processes more easily. 

## Why are EPCIS 2.0 and CBV important for Industry 4.0?

The evolution of Industry 4.0 and an increasingly connected supply chain demand standards to ensure the interoperability and trustworthy exchange of data. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards play a key role in achieving these goals. The interoperability of different systems can be achieved by using EPCIS 2.0 to provide a standardized way of describing and exchanging information about supply chain events. The CBV provides a standardized vocabulary that enables business partners to share information and understand one another's processes more easily. In an industry where time and efficiency are key, these standards can help organizations work more efficiently, minimize inventory, and make better decisions.

## EPCIS 2.0 for Industry 4.0

EPCIS 2.0's capabilities for Industry 4.0 can be articulated as follows:

### Streamlined Tracking

As Industry 4.0's emphasis on the internet of things (IoT) leads to the use of sensors, location tracking and RFID tags, there is a need for a streamlined method of tracking. EPCIS 2.0 provides a standardized method of tracking and sharing information about these in real-time, from different sources.

### Transparency and Traceability 

EPCIS 2.0 provides end-to-end visibility of a product's journey in the supply chain. This capability is important for Industry 4.0's emphasis on transparency and traceability.

### Improved Efficiency 

EPCIS 2.0 provides an efficient way for organizations to exchange real-time data with trading partners. The automation of data exchange minimizes the need for manual data entry and decreases errors. EPCIS 2.0 can also improve the speed of data flow, which is critical to the efficiency and responsiveness of Industry 4.0.

### Improved Decision-Making

EPCIS 2.0's data aggregation capabilities can help organizations make better decisions. By providing real-time data on product locations, inventory levels, and production schedules, organizations can make more informed decisions about inventory and production planning. 

## CBV for Industry 4.0

The CBV can help support Industry 4.0 in the following ways:

### A Common Vocabulary

Industry 4.0 involves the integration of various systems in different organizations. The CBV provides a standardized vocabulary that enables business partners to share information and understand each other's processes more easily. This standardization facilitates the integration of different systems for a more effective and efficient supply chain.

### Simplified Communication

The CBV can help simplify communication between different organizations. By using standardized terms and definitions, organizations can avoid confusion when communicating about business processes and activities. This standardization can lead to enhanced collaboration and streamlined communication.

### Better Decision-Making

The CBV enables organizations to make data-driven decisions. Standardized terms and definitions allow organizations to easily classify, categorize, and analyze data, leading to better decision-making.

## Case Study: EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in Action

An example of how EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can work together to enhance Industry 4.0 can be seen in the food industry. 

Food traceability and recall management are important in the food industry. The CBV provides a standardized vocabulary that enables business partners to share information and understand each other's processes more easily. Meanwhile, EPCIS 2.0 provides a standardized method of tracking and sharing information about food products in real-time.

A food recall typically involves quickly identifying affected products and removing them from shelves. Using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, affected products can be quickly identified and traced back to the source to determine where the problem originated. Once identified, the products can be quickly removed from shelves, minimizing the risk to consumers.

## Conclusion

The evolution of Industry 4.0 and an increasingly connected supply chain demands standards to ensure the interoperability and trustworthy exchange of data. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are key standards that can help address these needs. EPCIS 2.0 provides a standardized way of sharing information about supply chain events among different organizations. CBV provides a standardized vocabulary that allows for the consistent description of business processes and activities. Together, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help organizations work more efficiently, minimize inventory, and make better decisions. In the age of Industry 4.0, these standards are more important than ever.
