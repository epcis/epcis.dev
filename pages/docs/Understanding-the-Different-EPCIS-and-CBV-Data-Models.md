# Understanding the Different EPCIS and CBV Data Models

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) are standards used in electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions, specifically related to tracking and tracing of products in supply chains. These technologies make it possible for companies to easily track their products through all stages of the supply chain, improving visibility and efficiency. In this article, we will explore the different data models involved in EPCIS and CBV, and how they work.

## EPCIS Data Model

The EPCIS data model is designed specifically for tracking and tracing of products in a supply chain. It provides a standardized way of exchanging information about the movement of products between different parties in the supply chain. The core elements of the model include events, objects, and attributes.

### Events

Events are the key element of the EPCIS data model. They represent the movement of a product from one point in the supply chain to another. Events can be classified as one of four types:

- Object Event: This type of event represents the creation, transformation, or destruction of a product.
- Aggregation Event: This type of event represents the grouping of two or more products into a larger unit.
- Transaction Event: This type of event represents the exchange of ownership or possession of a product between two parties.
- Transformation Event: This type of event represents the change of state or condition of a product.

### Objects

Objects are used in the EPCIS data model to identify the products being tracked. Each product is assigned a unique electronic product code (EPC) that is used to identify it throughout the supply chain. Objects can be classified as one of two types:

- EPC Class: This type of object represents a group of similar products.
- EPC Instance: This type of object represents a specific product identified by its unique EPC.

### Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about the events and objects being tracked. There are three types of attributes in the EPCIS data model:

- Business Transaction: This type of attribute provides information about the business transaction associated with the event.
- EPC Global: This type of attribute provides information about the EPC code associated with the object being tracked.
- Custom: This type of attribute provides additional information that is specific to the business or industry.

## CBV Data Model

The CBV data model is designed to work in conjunction with the EPCIS data model. It provides a standardized way of exchanging product-related data between different parties in the supply chain. The core elements of the model include business vocabularies, semantic models, and document structures.

### Business Vocabularies

Business vocabularies provide a standard way of describing the terms used in EDI transactions. They define the meaning of each term and provide a standardized way of exchanging information about products in the supply chain. There are two main types of business vocabularies used in the CBV data model:

- Core Business Vocabulary: This type of vocabulary provides a standardized way of describing basic product information such as product name, description, and unit of measure.
- Industry-Specific Vocabulary: This type of vocabulary provides a standardized way of describing product information specific to a particular industry or business.

### Semantic Models

Semantic models provide a standard way of describing the relationships between different pieces of product-related data. They define the meaning of each data element and provide a standardized way of organizing the data. There are two main types of semantic models used in the CBV data model:

- Core Semantic Model: This type of model provides a standardized way of describing the relationships between basic product information such as product name, description, and unit of measure.
- Industry-Specific Semantic Model: This type of model provides a standardized way of describing the relationships between product information specific to a particular industry or business.

### Document Structures

Document structures provide a standard way of organizing the product-related data into electronic documents that can be exchanged between different parties in the supply chain. There are two main types of document structures used in the CBV data model:

- Core Document Structure: This type of structure provides a standardized way of organizing basic product information into electronic documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and shipping notices.
- Industry-Specific Document Structure: This type of structure provides a standardized way of organizing product information specific to a particular industry or business into electronic documents.

## How EPCIS and CBV Work Together

The EPCIS and CBV data models work together to provide a standardized way of tracking and tracing products in supply chains. The EPCIS data model is used to track the movement of products through the supply chain, while the CBV data model is used to exchange product-related data between different parties in the supply chain.

For example, when a product is shipped from a manufacturer to a distributor, the manufacturer will use the EPCIS data model to create an event that represents the transfer of the product to the distributor. The event will include the unique EPC code assigned to the product, as well as information about the business transaction associated with the transfer.

The distributor will then use the CBV data model to exchange product-related data with the manufacturer. This might include information about the product name, description, and unit of measure. The data will be organized using the semantic model and document structure specific to the industry or business.

By using these standardized data models, companies can easily track their products through all stages of the supply chain, improving visibility and efficiency. This makes it possible for companies to quickly identify and address any issues that arise, such as delays or quality problems.

## Conclusion

EPCIS and CBV are two data models used in electronic data interchange transactions related to tracking and tracing of products in supply chains. The EPCIS data model provides a standardized way of exchanging information about the movement of products in the supply chain, while the CBV data model provides a standardized way of exchanging product-related data between different parties in the supply chain. By using these standardized data models, companies can easily track their products through all stages of the supply chain, improving visibility and efficiency. As technologies continue to evolve, it is likely that these data models will play an increasingly important role in supply chain management.
