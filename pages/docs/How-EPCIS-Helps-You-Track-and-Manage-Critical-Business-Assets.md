# How EPCIS Helps You Track and Manage Critical Business Assets

Are you struggling to keep track of your critical business assets? Do you often find yourself not knowing who, what, when, where, why, and how things are happening across your supply chain and business operations? If so, then it may be time to consider the benefits of implementing an EPCIS system.

EPCIS, which stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, is a standardized format for sharing data between systems in real-time. By using EPCIS, businesses can gain complete visibility into their supply chain and business operations, allowing them to track and manage their critical assets more effectively.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standardized data format that provides a common language for sharing data between different systems. It is based on the Electronic Product Code (EPC) standard, which was developed by the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

The EPCIS standard defines a set of events that can be used to track the movement of assets across the supply chain. These events include information about the serial number of the asset, the location where it was scanned, the time and date of the scan, and any other relevant data.

## Why is EPCIS Important?

EPCIS provides a number of benefits to businesses, including:

### Real-Time Visibility:

EPCIS allows businesses to see what's happening across their supply chain and business operations in real-time. This allows them to quickly identify any problems or issues that may arise, and take action to resolve them before they become more serious.

### Improved Efficiency:

By using EPCIS, businesses can automate many of their supply chain and business operations processes, reducing the amount of time and effort required to track and manage their critical assets.

### Better Decision-Making:

EPCIS provides businesses with a wealth of data that can be used to make better decisions. By analyzing this data, businesses can identify trends and patterns, and use this information to optimize their supply chain and business operations.

### Enhanced Security:

EPCIS provides businesses with enhanced security features, such as encryption and authentication, to ensure that their data is protected from unauthorized access or tampering.

## How Does EPCIS Work?

EPCIS works by using a set of standardized events to track the movement of assets across the supply chain. These events include:

### Object Event:

The Object Event is used to track the physical movement of an asset across the supply chain. It includes information about the serial number of the asset, the location where it was scanned, the time and date of the scan, and any other relevant data.

### Aggregation Event:

The Aggregation Event is used to track the movement of groups of assets across the supply chain. It includes information about the parent-child relationships between assets, and allows businesses to track the movement of entire batches of products.

### Association Event:

The Association Event is used to track the relationship between two or more assets across the supply chain. It includes information about the nature of the relationship, and can be used to track things like component parts and raw materials.

### Disposition Event:

The Disposition Event is used to track the final disposition of an asset across the supply chain. It includes information about the final destination of the asset, such as a store or a customer.

## Implementing an EPCIS System

Implementing an EPCIS system requires a few key steps:

### Step 1: Define Your Objectives

The first step in implementing an EPCIS system is to define your objectives. What do you hope to achieve by implementing EPCIS? This could include things like improving efficiency, increasing visibility, and enhancing security.

### Step 2: Choose Your Technology

The next step is to choose the technology you will use to implement your EPCIS system. There are a variety of technologies available, including RFID, barcode scanning, and GPS tracking.

### Step 3: Define Your Processes

Once you have chosen your technology, you will need to define your processes for tracking and managing your critical assets. This could include things like tracking the movement of inventory in real-time, identifying potential bottlenecks in your supply chain, and automating manual processes.

### Step 4: Test and Refine Your System

After you have defined your processes, it's time to test and refine your EPCIS system. This will involve testing your system under different conditions to ensure that it is working as intended, and making any necessary adjustments to improve its performance.

## Conclusion

In today's fast-paced business environment, it is essential to have complete visibility into your supply chain and business operations. Implementing an EPCIS system can help you achieve this, providing you with the real-time data you need to track and manage your critical assets more effectively.

By implementing an EPCIS system, you can improve efficiency, make better decisions, enhance security, and achieve greater visibility into your supply chain and business operations. So why wait? Start exploring the benefits of EPCIS today, and take your business to the next level!
