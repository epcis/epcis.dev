# How EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have transformed supply chain management

Supply chain management has been a challenge for many industries, especially with the increasing complexity of global trade and the need for more visibility and control over the flow of goods. For years, organizations have struggled to find a system that could provide the necessary transparency and traceability of their supply chain processes. However, with the development of the EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV (Core Business Vocabulary), the management of supply chains has been transformed.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard for electronic event tracking that enables the sharing of trading partner event data in real-time. EPCIS provides an industry-standard format for exchanging data captured by a variety of technologies including RFID, GPS or barcodes. EPCIS 2.0 is an updated version that enhances the original standard by including new features, such as:

- Improved queries and filtering capabilities
- Expanded event types
- Introduction of new data structures
- Support for Web Services Security

Overall, EPCIS 2.0 is an industry-recognized standard for sharing real-time data between trading partners, improving collaboration and supply chain visibility.

## What is the CBV?

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a standard vocabulary developed by GS1 that defines the terms used in EPCIS 2.0. The CBV establishes a common language for companies to understand and communicate information about their product flows, from raw materials to finished products. 

Using the CBV ensures that all supply chain partners are using the same terminology when referring to the same objects, events, and attributes for product life-cycle management. The CBV has been a game-changer in the industry, as it provides consistency and clarity in supply chain communication,

## How EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have transformed supply chain management

The integration of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV has transformed supply chain management in several ways:

### Improved Visibility

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have improved supply chain visibility significantly; this is because they allow the entire supply chain network to capture and share data in real-time. This enhanced visibility enables companies to monitor product movements, from manufacturing through to transportation, providing complete transparency.

Real-time data-sharing removes guesswork and reduces errors in supply chain management, ensuring that stakeholders have the necessary information to make informed decisions. The resulting transparency also increases accountability and reduces instances of product loss or theft.

### Enhanced Efficiency 

The implementation of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV has decreased supply chain disruptions and delays by improving the communication and collaboration between supply chain partners.

By establishing a consistent vocabulary for product flow, the CBV enables companies to streamline their communication and optimize their data-sharing processes. As a result, supply chain partners can take immediate action as soon as an event occurs.

Additionally, EPCIS 2.0's improved query and filtering capabilities translate raw data into meaningful insights, enabling stakeholders to determine which products are moving faster or slower than expected. This visibility increases efficiency, prompts activity planning and real-time decision-making by providing accurate and precise data-based insights.

### Better Decision-making

Real-time data sharing and improved visibility lead to better decision-making by enabling stakeholders to access accurate and timely information. EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have democratized access to supply chain data, making it available to all stakeholders, regardless of geographic location. 

With the inclusion of new event types, such as temperature deviations and shipment damage, supply chain partners can learn more about specific events that may have caused product damage or loss. This information empowers supply chain partners to make informed decisions about their processes and where improvements can be made.

The enhanced data intelligence provided by EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV ensures that supply chain partners experience a more proactive supply chain, where decisions can be made in advance of issues arising.

## The Importance of Standardization

The integration of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV has established a standardization of terms and communication throughout the supply chain. Standardization has benefits, including:

- Improved efficiency: by reducing the time spent on communication related to product flows by eliminating misunderstandings of terms used to describe events, objects, or attributes; 
- Visibility: Standardization means that partners throughout the supply chain network can have access to the same information and track products precisely throughout the supply chain;
- Improvement: Standardization allows for the identification of trends and bottlenecks, allowing stakeholders to optimize their supply chain operations by eliminating redundancies, improving processes and addressing problems early on.

Standardization is critical to creating an efficient and effective supply chain that can deliver the necessary transparency, traceability and data-driven insights that lead to better decision-making across the organization.

## Conclusion

The development and implementation of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV has brought significant changes to supply chain management, including; improved visibility, enhanced efficiency, improved decision-making processes, and standardization of terminology. These changes have allowed for more transparency, traceability and effective supply chain management, placing companies in a better position to identify and address supply chain opportunities and challenges. Overall, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have created a more informed and efficient supply chain, paving the way for an industry in which the supply chain is now seen as a strategic asset to be managed carefully, driving supply chain optimization and better business outcomes.
