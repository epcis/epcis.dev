# EPCIS and CBV for Reverse Logistics

Reverse logistics is a crucial aspect of supply chain management that involves the movement of goods from their final destination, typically the consumer, back to their point of origin, typically the manufacturer or retailer, for recycling, disposal, or reuse. This process often involves multiple stakeholders, from the end consumer to the original manufacturer, and as such requires a unified system to track, trace, and manage the return of goods.

To facilitate this process, several standards have emerged over the years, with two prominent ones being the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). In this deep dive, we will explore how these standards complement each other to enhance reverse logistics management.

## EPCIS

EPCIS is a GS1 standard that provides a standard format for sharing event data related to the movement and status of products as they move through the supply chain. EPCIS helps to standardize data sharing and improve supply chain visibility, facilitating track and trace applications and enhancing supply chain responsiveness.

EPCIS is built on top of GS1 identifiers such as the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC), and Global Location Number (GLN), and provides a standardized vocabulary for describing events and their relationships, including what happened, when, where, and why. This vocabulary includes event types such as shipment, receiving, and disposition, and advanced concepts such as aggregation and transformation.

EPCIS also allows for the creation of EPCIS documents, which are structured XML documents containing event data that conform to the EPCIS data model. These documents can be shared between different supply chain partners to enhance visibility and facilitate decision making.

## CBV

CBV, on the other hand, is a standard developed by the Open Applications Group (OAGi) that provides a common language for describing business transactions and their associated data elements. CBV is focused on the business processes and data structures that are necessary to conduct electronic transactions, providing a vocabulary for describing the interactions between different systems and organizations.

CBV is structured around business objects, which represent the underlying business entities and their relationships. These objects are organized into modules, which correspond to key business areas such as Sales, Purchase, and Logistics. CBV also defines XML schemas for these business objects, providing a standardized way to exchange data between different systems.

One of the key advantages of CBV is that it allows for the seamless exchange of data between different systems and organizations, enabling end-to-end integration and visibility in the supply chain. By providing a common language for describing business transactions, CBV helps eliminate the need for custom integrations and costly point-to-point connections, resulting in greater efficiency and cost savings.

## EPCIS and CBV Integration

The integration of EPCIS and CBV can enhance reverse logistics management by providing a standardized way to track, trace, and manage the return of goods. By leveraging EPCIS to provide event data related to the movement and status of products in the supply chain, and CBV to provide a common language for describing the associated business transactions and data elements, supply chain partners can collaborate seamlessly to manage returns.

For example, when a consumer returns a product, an EPCIS event can be generated that captures the return event, including the product identification and its associated location. This event can then be shared between the manufacturer and the retailer using standardized EPCIS documents, enabling end-to-end visibility of the return process.

At the same time, CBV can be used to describe the business transaction associated with the return, such as the issuance of a return authorization and the subsequent return of the product to the manufacturer. These transactions can be described using the standardized CBV objects and XML schemas, facilitating the exchange of data between the different systems and organizations involved in the process.

Furthermore, the integration of EPCIS and CBV can enable enhanced analytics and reporting capabilities for reverse logistics. By collecting and analyzing event data and transactional data, supply chain partners can gain insights into the performance of the return process, including key metrics such as return rates, turnaround times, and cost analysis.

In summary, EPCIS and CBV are two important standards that can be integrated to enhance reverse logistics management. By leveraging EPCIS to provide event data related to the movement and status of products in the supply chain, and CBV to provide a common language for describing the associated business transactions and data elements, supply chain partners can collaborate seamlessly to manage returns. This integration also enables enhanced analytics and reporting capabilities, facilitating continuous improvement and optimization of the reverse logistics process.
