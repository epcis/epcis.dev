# A Beginner's Guide to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

If you are in the supply chain industry, you may already be familiar with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. For those who aren't, this guide will provide an overview of these two tools and how they are used in supply chain management.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standard for exchanging data between different trading partners in the supply chain. This standard is developed by GS1, a global organization that specializes in creating standards for the supply chain industry. EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services and is used to collect and store data about the movement of goods within the supply chain.

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 provides a framework for capturing, storing, and sharing events related to the movement of goods within the supply chain. These events can include things like the receipt of goods, the shipment of goods, and the delivery of goods. By using this standard, different trading partners can share information about these events in a consistent and standardized way.

## What is CBV?

CBV stands for Core Business Vocabulary and is a set of attributes that can be included in EPCIS events. These attributes provide additional information about the goods being tracked and can include things like batch numbers, expiration dates, and serial numbers.

By including CBV attributes in EPCIS events, you can create a complete record of the movement of goods within the supply chain. This information can be used to improve supply chain visibility, increase efficiency, and reduce the risk of errors and fraud.

## How are GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV used in supply chain management?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are used in a variety of ways in supply chain management. Here are some examples:

### Improved supply chain visibility

By using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, you can create a complete record of the movement of goods within the supply chain. This allows different trading partners to see where an item is at any given time and track its movement from one location to another.

Improved supply chain visibility can help you identify bottlenecks and areas where you can improve efficiency. For example, if you notice that a particular item is frequently delayed at a specific location, you may be able to determine the cause and take steps to address it.

### Enhanced traceability

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide a level of traceability that was previously difficult or impossible to achieve. By including CBV attributes such as batch numbers and expiration dates, you can track each individual item and ensure that it is properly accounted for at every step of the supply chain.

This level of traceability is particularly important in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, where safety and quality are paramount. By using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, you can ensure that these products are properly tracked and that any problems can be quickly identified and addressed.

### Reduced risk of errors and fraud

By using a standardized system like GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, you can reduce the risk of errors and fraud in the supply chain. By capturing and sharing consistent data about the movement of goods, you can identify discrepancies and potential problems before they get out of hand.

This can help you address issues like counterfeit products and ensure that all products are properly accounted for. By reducing the risk of errors and fraud, you can increase the safety and reliability of the supply chain.
