# Optimizing Data Accuracy with EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps are an essential tool for optimizing data accuracy in supply chain management. They allow for the tracking of products from their source to their point of consumption, providing complete visibility and traceability of goods throughout the entire supply chain. By utilizing EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps, companies can achieve maximum accuracy and minimize errors in their supply chain data.

## What are EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps?

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps are a set of standardized data elements that provide information on the key events that occur within the supply chain. These include the receipt of goods, the movement of goods through the supply chain, and the final delivery of goods to the customer.

The BizSteps framework is built on the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard, which is maintained by the GS1 organization. GS1 is a not-for-profit organization that provides standards for supply chain management, including barcodes, RFID tags, and other data capture technologies.

By utilizing EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps, companies can ensure that their supply chain data is accurate, complete, and meets the requirements of their customers and regulatory bodies.

## How do EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps optimize data accuracy?

One of the key benefits of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps is that they provide a standardized framework for capturing and sharing supply chain data. This means that all parties involved in the supply chain can use the same data elements, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies in the data.

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps also provide a high level of granularity in supply chain data. This means that companies can track products at a granular level, from individual units to batches and lots. This level of detail ensures that companies can accurately trace the movement of goods through the supply chain, providing complete visibility of their products at all times.

In addition, EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps provide a standardized way of capturing data from different sources, such as barcode scanners, RFID readers, and other data capture devices. This reduces the risk of errors in the data, as all data is captured using a standardized format.

## Examples of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps in action

To illustrate the benefits of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps in optimizing data accuracy, let's look at a few examples of how they are used in different supply chain scenarios.

### Pharmaceutical supply chain

In the pharmaceutical industry, ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs is paramount. EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can be used to track drugs from their production to their dispensing to the patient. This allows for complete traceability of drugs throughout the supply chain, reducing the risk of counterfeit or adulterated drugs entering the market.

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can also be used to track the temperature and humidity of drugs during transport and storage. This is particularly important for drugs that require specific temperature and humidity conditions, such as vaccines.

### Food supply chain

In the food industry, EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can be used to track the movement of food products from farm to table. This provides complete visibility of food products throughout the supply chain, from their source to their final destination.

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can also be used to ensure the safety of food products by tracking the temperature and other environmental conditions during transport and storage. This helps to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and other pathogens that can lead to foodborne illness.

### Retail supply chain

In the retail industry, EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can be used to track the movement of products from the manufacturer to the store shelf. This provides complete visibility of products throughout the supply chain, allowing retailers to optimize their inventory management and ensure that products are always in stock.

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can also be used to track product recalls and other quality issues. This enables retailers to quickly identify and remove products from their shelves that may pose a risk to consumers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps are an essential tool for optimizing data accuracy in supply chain management. They provide a standardized framework for capturing and sharing supply chain data, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps also provide a high level of granularity in supply chain data, allowing companies to track products at a granular level and ensure complete visibility and traceability of goods throughout the entire supply chain.

By using EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps, companies can optimize their supply chain data accuracy, achieve greater efficiency and transparency, and comply with regulatory requirements.
