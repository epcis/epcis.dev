# The Future Direction of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in Supply Chain Management

The supply chain industry is experiencing significant disruptions, especially in the last few years. Consumers are increasingly demanding for transparency, traceability and accountability in the products they purchase. Manufacturers, retailers, and logistics companies are, therefore, in pursuit of methods to provide these to their customers. This is where GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV come in.

 GS1, the global body responsible for barcode standards, created EPCIS 2.0 to help companies gain better visibility and transparency in their supply chains. One of the features of EPCIS 2.0 is the creation of a standard for capturing the chain of ownership, which is called the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). In this blog post, we will take a deep dive into the future direction of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in supply chain management.

## The Current State of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is not new to the supply chain industry. It was first introduced in 2007 as a way of providing better end-to-end visibility in the supply chain. Itâ€™s a protocol that allows trading partners to share and track information about the movement and status of products.

CBV, on the other hand, is a dictionary that standardizes the vocabulary used to describe the events that occur throughout the supply chain. CBV defines common terms and vocabulary that enable companies to talk the same language regardless of their sector or country of operation.

Currently, many companies are still new to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, and as such, there has been slow adoption of the protocol. However, the benefits of this technology are becoming apparent, and more companies are beginning to adopt EPCIS 2.0 and CBV into their supply chain management processes.

## The Future of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

The future direction of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV shows a lot of promise for the supply chain industry. Here are some of the potential directions:

### Emerging Technologies

Technologies like AI, Blockchain, and IoT are set to revolutionize the supply chain industry, and GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV have a massive role to play in that future. These emerging technologies will enable businesses to collect and analyze data at different points in their supply chains. The data collected will be used to enhance supply chain transparency, accountability, and traceability. This data will be fed into the EPCIS 2.0 protocol, which will ensure all trading partners in the supply chain have access to real-time information.

For example, IoT can be used to collect data from supply chain nodes like storage, shipping containers, and trucks. This data can then be analyzed to determine the best delivery routes, determine the best times for shipping, and identify supply chain bottlenecks.

### Enhancing Traceability

Traceability is one of the key benefits of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. However, there is still room for improvement. In the future, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV will move towards creating a more transparent and accountable supply chain.

With the use of digital identity, businesses and consumers will be able to track products at each step of the supply chain. This will help to eliminate counterfeit products, improve product quality, and build trust between businesses and consumers.

### Support for Regulatory Compliance

Regulatory compliance is a significant issue for many businesses, especially in the food and medical industries. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV have enabled businesses to collect and analyze data that meet regulatory standards. The future of the protocol shows even greater support for regulatory compliance in the supply chain industry.

In the future, there will be a complete integration of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV with regulatory standards. This will enable companies to track products at each point in the supply chain, reducing the need for manual tracking and documentation.

### Improved Collaboration

Collaboration in the supply chain is essential for effective supply chain management. However, many businesses still struggle with collaboration due to issues like data privacy and security.

With the adoption of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, businesses will be able to improve collaboration through better sharing of data. The future of the protocol will see further development of collaboration tools built into the EPCIS 2.0 protocol. This will enable more efficient supply chain management.

## Conclusion

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV have already begun to change the way supply chains operate. The protocol provides end-to-end visibility, accountability, and traceability. In the future, its adoption will increase, and the impact of the technology will become more apparent.

The future of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV lies in the adoption of emerging technologies, the enhancement of traceability, support for regulatory compliance, and improved collaboration. These solutions aim to increase transparency, trust and accountability in the supply chain. As more companies adopt these technologies, the supply chain will become more efficient and have greater visibility.
