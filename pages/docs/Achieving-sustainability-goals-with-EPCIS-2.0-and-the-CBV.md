# Achieving Sustainability Goals with EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

Sustainability has become a crucial concern for businesses and organizations across the globe. With the increase in global warming, degradation of natural resources, and social inequality, the need for sustainable practices has become imperative in today's world. The use of Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) are powerful tools in achieving sustainability goals. In this blog post, we will explore how EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can be used to achieve sustainability goals and in turn, transform businesses and organizations.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is an interoperable standard that provides a framework to capture and share real-time information on products, goods, and services throughout supply chains. The standard was developed by the GS1 Global Office, the organization behind the barcodes used in stores worldwide. The EPCIS 2.0 standard describes what information is captured by a company as goods are created, transported, and sold through the supply chain. The information captures the life-cycle and identity of the product and includes information such as when and where the product was manufactured, transported, stored, and sold.

## What is the CBV?

CBV stands for Core Business Vocabulary, and is a subset of the EPCIS 2.0 standard. It is a standard way of describing and classifying products and services, using a common language that can be shared across different systems and applications. The CBV defines a common set of terms and definitions that can be used by businesses to describe their products and services.

## How can EPCIS 2.0 and CBV help achieve sustainability goals?

### Tracking Sustainability Metrics

One way that EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can be used to achieve sustainability goals is by tracking sustainability metrics throughout the supply chain. By using EPCIS 2.0 to capture information about a product's life-cycle, companies can track sustainability metrics such as energy usage, resource consumption, water usage, and waste generation. By tracking sustainability metrics in this way, companies can identify areas where they can reduce their environmental impact and improve their sustainability performance.

### Reducing Carbon Footprint

Another way that EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help achieve sustainability goals is by reducing a company's carbon footprint. By using EPCIS 2.0 to track the transportation of goods throughout the supply chain, companies can identify opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing the transportation routes and modes used. Companies can also use CBV to identify more sustainable materials and products that have a lower carbon footprint.

### Improving Supply Chain Visibility

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can also help improve supply chain visibility, which is critical for achieving sustainability goals. By capturing real-time information about products, goods, and services throughout the supply chain, companies can identify areas where they can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and optimize their overall environmental performance. By using CBV to standardize descriptions of products and services, businesses can also understand the environmental and social impact of the products and services they offer.

### Promoting Social Responsibility

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can also be used to promote social responsibility. By capturing information about the social impact of products and services, businesses can identify areas where they can improve their social responsibility performance. For example, companies can track fair labor practices, responsible sourcing, and the use of sustainable materials. By using CBV to standardize descriptions of products and services, companies can also communicate their social responsibility efforts to customers and stakeholders.

## Conclusion

Sustainability has become a critical concern for businesses and organizations across the globe. By using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, businesses can achieve sustainability goals by tracking sustainability metrics, reducing their carbon footprint, improving supply chain visibility, and promoting social responsibility. The use of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is not only beneficial for businesses but also for the planet and society at large. By transforming businesses and organizations through the adoption of these standards, we can create a more sustainable, prosperous, and equitable world for future generations.
