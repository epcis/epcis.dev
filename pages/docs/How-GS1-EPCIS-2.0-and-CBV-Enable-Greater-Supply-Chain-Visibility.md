# How GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Enable Greater Supply Chain Visibility

Supply chain visibility has become a crucial aspect of the modern supply chain. With increased globalization and complexities in product flows, identifying and addressing supply chain challenges has become a priority for many organizations. The utilization of technology such as the GS1 Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) has revolutionized supply chain visibility. This article will take a deep dive into the technologies and explain how they enable greater supply chain visibility.

## Understanding GS1 EPCIS 2.0

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standardized communication protocol used to track and trace the movement of goods across the supply chain. It was developed by the GS1 Global Standards organization to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility across multiple industries. EPCIS 2.0 has been designed to work with other GS1 standards such as the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC), and the Global Location Number (GLN), which can be used to uniquely identify products, shipments, and locations.

EPCIS 2.0 provides standardized communication through event-based data sharing. The data is exchanged through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) messages or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). When an event occurs in the supply chain such as the arrival of a shipment at a warehouse, EPCIS generates an event that includes information such as the location, time, and what product was received. This information is transmitted in the EPCIS event format, which is a standard XML format that contains all the necessary data fields.

## Understanding Core Business Vocabulary

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of GS1 standards used to provide a common understanding of business concepts and language for the exchange of supply chain data. CBV includes a standardized set of terms and definitions that describes product, location, and business processes. CBV works in conjunction with EPCIS to ensure a common language is used in the exchange of supply chain data.

CBV consists of several components such as the Basic Business Vocabulary (BBV) and Simple Business Messages (SBM). BBV is a set of common vocabulary terms that are used to describe business concepts, such as product and location. SBM provides a set of standardized messages that define specific business transactions such as purchase orders, shipment notifications, and invoice messages.

## How EPCIS 2.0 and CBV Enable Greater Supply Chain Visibility

The combination of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV enables greater supply chain visibility by providing a standardized communication protocol and a common language for the exchange of supply chain data. This allows for data to be shared across multiple organizations and different systems, providing end-to-end supply chain visibility from source to destination.

One of the key benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is the ability to track and trace products across the supply chain. By using unique identification numbers such as GTIN and SSCC, products can be uniquely identified and their movements tracked throughout the supply chain. This enhances product visibility and reduces the risk of counterfeits, diversion, or gray market products entering the supply chain.

Another benefit of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is the ability to identify and address supply chain inefficiencies. By sharing data such as shipment notifications and delivery confirmations, organizations can identify bottlenecks in the supply chain and take corrective action. This can lead to improvements in supply chain performance, reduced lead times, and lower costs.

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV also enable greater collaboration between organizations in the supply chain. By sharing data through a standardized communication protocol, partners in the supply chain can work together to improve performance and address challenges. This can lead to closer relationships and a more efficient supply chain.

## Conclusion

The utilization of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV has revolutionized supply chain visibility. By providing a standardized communication protocol and a common language for the exchange of supply chain data, organizations can achieve end-to-end visibility from source to destination. This enhances product visibility, identifies inefficiencies, and promotes collaboration between organizations in the supply chain. As a result, organizations can drive improvements in supply chain performance, reduce lead times, and lower costs.
