# The Role of the GLN in the GS1 CBV

As businesses around the world continue to streamline their operations and improve their supply chains, they are looking for standards and systems that can help them achieve these goals. One such system is the GS1 CBV (Core Business Vocabulary), which provides a common language for businesses to use when exchanging data and transactions.

At the heart of the GS1 CBV is the Global Location Number (GLN). In this blog post, we will explore the role of the GLN within the GS1 CBV, including what it is, how it works, and why it is so important.

## What is the GLN?

In simple terms, a Global Location Number (GLN) is a unique identifier used to identify and locate parties and locations involved in business transactions. It is a globally recognized standard that allows businesses to precisely identify and communicate with each other.

The GLN is composed of a 13-digit number, each of which represents a certain aspect of the location being identified, such as the country, the company, the location, and the sub-location. This makes it a highly specific and precise identifier that can be used in many different contexts.

## How Does the GLN Work?

When a business needs to identify a location using a GLN, it can simply query the relevant database to retrieve the information it needs. This information might include, for example, the location's address or other relevant details.

The GLN can also be used in a variety of different types of transactions. It can be embedded in barcodes or other types of data standards, which makes it easy for businesses to exchange information with each other in a standardized way.

Overall, the GLN is a highly versatile and powerful tool that can help businesses to streamline their operations, reduce errors, and improve their overall efficiency.
