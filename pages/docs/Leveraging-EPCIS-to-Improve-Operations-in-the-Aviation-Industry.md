# Leveraging EPCIS to Improve Operations in the Aviation Industry

As a complex industry with many moving parts, aviation relies heavily on coordinated efforts from various players to ensure safety, efficiency, and profitability. From airlines to ground handlers, manufacturers, and maintenance providers, multiple parties are involved in every aspect of aviation, which can make it challenging to track and manage the flow of goods and services.

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a promising technology that offers a solution to these issues. EPCIS is a standard that provides a way for organizations to share and track data about physical objects as they move through the supply chain. In the aviation industry, EPCIS provides an opportunity for stakeholders to track aircraft parts and equipment, improve safety, reduce costs, and streamline operations.

## What is EPCIS?
EPCIS is based on the Electronic Product Code (EPC), a unique identifier assigned to physical objects, such as products or equipment, using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. RFID is a technology that uses radio waves to automatically identify objects and capture data about them. EPCIS utilizes this unique coding system to track objects and share information related to their location, status, and condition throughout the supply chain.

EPCIS is essentially a database that allows organizations to share data about an object's movements and activities across various locations, including supply chains, warehouses, and transportation networks. This data can include information such as the date and time an object was scanned, the location of the scan, and the identity of the party performing the scan.

## Benefits of EPCIS in the Aviation Industry
The aviation industry involves a broad range of activities and services that require coordination and tracking of various assets, including aircraft parts and equipment, cargo, and maintenance records. Implementing EPCIS can provide a range of benefits to players in the aviation industry.

### Improved Safety
Safety is of paramount importance in the aviation industry, and the use of EPCIS can help improve safety in several ways. By tracking parts and equipment to ensure they are in good working condition, companies can take prompt corrective actions, avoiding safety incidents that may otherwise result in damage or loss of life. Additionally, EPCIS can help log the maintenance history of aircraft parts, ensuring that they are properly serviced and inspected in accordance with regulations.

Another safety-related benefit of EPCIS is its ability to facilitate product recalls quickly. In case of a safety issue with an aircraft part, EPCIS can help identify the location and extent of the problem, thereby reducing the risk of harm to passengers and crew.

### Reduced Costs
The aviation industry is known for its high costs, and EPCIS can help reduce expenses drastically. By streamlining operations, optimizing inventory management, and increasing the efficiency of the supply chain, airlines can save money and time. For instance, they can manage inventory levels more effectively, reducing the amount of cash tied up in unused parts and equipment. Furthermore, EPCIS can help airlines identify the most efficient routes and modes of transportation, apart from providing real-time updates that help avoid delays and spoilage.

### Better Traceability
Tracking the movement of aircraft parts, equipment, and other assets is critical in the aviation industry, especially for compliance and regulatory purposes. EPCIS provides traceability to aircraft parts, and component movements from one party to another is recorded, and auditable. This information can help businesses keep track of the movement of their assets and provide complete documentation for regulatory or legal purposes.

### Improved Collaboration
The aviation industry is made up of many players who collaborate to achieve operational success. EPCIS presents an opportunity for each player in the industry to share data, resulting in real-time updates across the industry. When data is available in real-time, businesses can do more than just collaborate; they can also determine the root cause of issues and defects quickly, and take corrective actions in near-real-time.

## Use Cases for EPCIS in Aviation Industry
EPCIS can be used in various ways in the aviation industry. Here are a few examples.

### Parts Tracking
One use case for EPCIS is parts tracking. By assigning EPCs to parts such as engines, landing gear, and control systems, manufacturers can track these parts throughout their lifecycle, from production to installation, through maintenance and ultimately to retirement. By having a clear view of the entire history of these crucial components, stakeholders can make better decisions, avoid delays, and reduce waste.

### Maintenance Management
EPCIS can help track the maintenance of aircraft parts and equipment, providing airlines with a better understanding of the maintenance process, including inspections, repairs, and overhauls. With EPCIS, engineers can view maintenance logs and manage them easily, ensuring that parts are maintained according to their service requirements.

### Logistics Management
EPCIS can also play a significant role in logistics management. With EPCIS, airlines and ground handling companies can track cargo and other goods that require detailed tracking, resulting in accurate and up-to-date tracking of cargo movement. Additionally, EPCIS can help with inventory management, identifying which parts are holding up operations or taking up space in the warehouse.

## Conclusion
EPCIS provides a promising solution to the operational challenges faced by the aviation industry. By leveraging EPCIS, airlines and other stakeholders can keep track of their assets, improve safety, reduce costs, and boost overall efficiency. EPCIS can be used in various ways across the industry, from logistics management to parts tracking and maintenance management. With its potential for reducing costs, improving safety, and streamlining processes, EPCIS is a technology that every player in the aviation industry should consider adopting.
