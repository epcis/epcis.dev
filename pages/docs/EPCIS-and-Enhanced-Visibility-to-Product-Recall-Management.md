# EPCIS and Enhanced Visibility to Product Recall Management

In recent years, product recalls have been an increasingly common problem across all industries. According to a recent report by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, there were over 30 recalls per week in 2019 alone - a staggering number that highlights the importance of having a robust and efficient recall management system in place. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at how EPCIS can enhance visibility to product recalls, enabling businesses to better manage these types of events.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services. Simply put, it is a standardized framework for sharing data across supply chains, allowing businesses to track products from the point of origin all the way through to the end consumer. EPCIS enables businesses to capture and share information on a variety of attributes, including product location, condition, status, and more. This data can be used to improve supply chain efficiency, enhance product tracking and tracing, and ultimately, improve overall operational performance.

## The Role of EPCIS in Product Recall Management

When it comes to product recalls, time is of the essence. The faster a company is able to identify and respond to a recall event, the more effectively it can mitigate any potential damage to its brand reputation, as well as minimize the risk of harm to consumers. By leveraging EPCIS data, businesses can gain critical insights into their products’ movements and status throughout the supply chain, enabling them to quickly and easily identify affected items in the event of a recall.

Specifically, EPCIS enables enhanced visibility into the following aspects of product recall management:

### 1. Tracing Affected Products

In the event of a recall, businesses must be able to quickly identify which products have been affected and where those products are located. With EPCIS, businesses have a single, standardized framework for capturing and sharing this information, making it much easier to trace affected products back to their point of origin.

### 2. Notifying All Relevant Parties

Effective recall management requires not only identifying affected products, but also notifying all relevant parties - including suppliers, distributors, retailers, and consumers - in a timely manner. EPCIS enables businesses to quickly and easily share recall information with all relevant parties, ensuring that everyone is aware of the issue and can take immediate action as needed.

### 3. Isolating and Quarantining Affected Products

Once affected products have been identified, it’s crucial that businesses are able to isolate and quarantine those items to prevent them from reaching consumers. With EPCIS, businesses can quickly identify affected products and track them throughout the supply chain, making it easier to isolate and quarantine those items as needed.

### 4. Retrieving Affected Products

In some cases, businesses may need to retrieve affected products from retail shelves or even from consumers’ homes. EPCIS can help businesses track affected products to specific locations and provide information on how to retrieve those items, making the process of product retrieval much more efficient.

## Best Practices for Using EPCIS in Product Recall Management

While EPCIS can provide valuable insights into product recall management, there are several best practices that businesses should follow to ensure that they are leveraging this data effectively. These include:

### 1. Establishing a Clear Recall Management Plan

Before a recall event occurs, businesses should establish a clear plan for how they will manage the situation. This plan should outline key steps, including how to identify and isolate affected products, how to notify relevant parties, and how to retrieve affected items. By having a clear plan in place, businesses can respond more effectively to recall events when they occur.

### 2. Capturing Comprehensive EPCIS Data

To effectively leverage EPCIS data, businesses must ensure that they are capturing comprehensive information on their products’ movements and status throughout the supply chain. This includes details on everything from product location and condition to inventory levels and shipping information.

### 3. Regularly Reviewing and Analyzing EPCIS Data

To gain the most value from EPCIS data, businesses should regularly review and analyze this information to identify trends and patterns that may indicate potential issues or opportunities for improvement. This requires having the right tools in place to effectively capture, store, and analyze EPCIS data.

### 4. Communicating Effectively with All Relevant Parties

Effective recall management requires clear and consistent communication with all relevant parties - including suppliers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. Businesses should ensure that they have the right communication channels in place to quickly and effectively notify all parties of a recall event, as well as provide updates and guidance as needed.

## Conclusion

Product recalls can have a significant impact on businesses, both from a financial standpoint and in terms of brand reputation. By leveraging EPCIS data, businesses can enhance visibility into their products’ movements and status throughout the supply chain, enabling them to quickly and effectively manage recall events as they occur. By following best practices for using EPCIS in product recall management, businesses can minimize the risk of damage from these types of events and ensure that they are able to respond in a timely and effective manner.
