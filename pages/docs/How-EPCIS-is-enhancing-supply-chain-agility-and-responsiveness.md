# How EPCIS is Enhancing Supply Chain Agility and Responsiveness

The supply chain industry has transformed significantly over the years. Organizations are looking for new ways to tackle challenges such as inefficiencies, errors, and lack of visibility. The use of technology has helped organizations to improve their operations and enhance their supply chain efficiency. One technology that has gained popularity in the supply chain industry is EPCIS. In this blog post, we’ll explore how EPCIS is enhancing supply chain agility and responsiveness.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services. It is an industry-standard for sharing information for tracking products and assets through the supply chain. The EPCIS standard enables organizations to have visibility into their supply chain operations in real-time. It makes it possible to track products at different stages of the supply chain, including manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, and retail.

The EPCIS standard was developed by EPCglobal, a division of GS1. EPCglobal is a not-for-profit organization that specializes in the development of global supply chain standards. The EPCIS standard is part of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) solution suite. The EPC solution suite comprises different standards such as the EPC Tag Data Standard, EPC Tag Data Translation, and the RFID Reader Protocol.

## How EPCIS Enhances Supply Chain Agility and Responsiveness

### Improved Visibility

One of the main advantages of EPCIS is improved visibility. It provides real-time information on the location and status of products in the supply chain. This information is critical for organizations that face challenges such as stockouts, overstocking, and inefficient inventory management. With EPCIS, organizations have a real-time view of their inventory levels and can respond quickly to stockouts and overstocking situations.

EPCIS also improves visibility by providing real-time information on product movement. This information is useful for identifying bottlenecks in the supply chain and improving supply chain efficiency. For example, if there is a delay in product movement, organizations can identify the cause of the delay and take corrective action to ensure timely delivery.

#### Case Study: Bosch & EPCIS

Bosch is a leading supplier of automotive parts and systems. The company adopted EPCIS to improve its supply chain visibility. With EPCIS, Bosch has improved its inventory management and has reduced stockouts. The company can also track the movement of its products across the supply chain and identify delays in product delivery. Bosch has increased its operational efficiency by using EPCIS to optimize its supply chain operations.

### Improved Traceability

EPCIS also enables organizations to trace products from the point of origin to the point of consumption. It provides information on the movement of products as they move through the supply chain. This information is useful for organizations that face regulatory compliance requirements. It also helps organizations to track products in the event of a product recall.

With EPCIS, organizations can quickly identify the source of a product issue and take corrective action. This improves product quality and reduces the impact of product issues on the organization’s reputation. Improved traceability also enables organizations to optimize their supply chain operations.

#### Case Study: Kimberly-Clark & EPCIS

Kimberly-Clark is a leading manufacturer of personal care and consumer products. The company uses EPCIS to improve supply chain traceability. By using EPCIS, Kimberly-Clark can track its products from the point of origin to the point of consumption. The company has improved its ability to respond to regulatory requirements and has reduced its risk exposure. Kimberly-Clark has also improved its supply chain efficiency by using EPCIS to optimize its supply chain processes.

### Improved Collaboration

EPCIS also enables improved collaboration between supply chain partners. It provides real-time information on product movement and inventory levels. This information is useful for suppliers, distributors, and retailers who need to work together to ensure timely delivery of products to customers.

With EPCIS, organizations can share information with their supply chain partners in real-time. This improves collaboration and reduces the risk of miscommunication. Improved collaboration also enables organizations to respond quickly to changes in customer demand.

#### Case Study: Walmart & EPCIS

Walmart is a leading retailer that has adopted EPCIS to improve supply chain collaboration. With EPCIS, Walmart can receive real-time information on inventory levels and product movement. This information is useful for Walmart’s suppliers who need to ensure the timely delivery of products to Walmart stores. With improved collaboration, Walmart has reduced supply chain costs and has improved the availability of products in its stores.

## Conclusion

EPCIS is an industry-standard for sharing information for tracking products and assets through the supply chain. It provides improved visibility, better traceability, and improved collaboration between supply chain partners. EPCIS enables organizations to respond quickly to changes in customer demand, optimize their supply chain processes, and reduce supply chain costs. The use of EPCIS is becoming increasingly popular in the supply chain industry, and organizations that adopt this technology will gain a competitive advantage.
