# Achieving Business Agility with EPCIS and CBV

As businesses continue to evolve and adapt to changing market conditions, achieving business agility has become more important than ever before. Business agility is the ability to respond to changes quickly and efficiently, while still maintaining effective operations and delivering on commitments to customers. In today’s fast-paced business environment, achieving business agility is critical to success.

One approach to achieving business agility is through the use of EPCIS and CBV. These technologies offer a range of benefits that can help businesses improve visibility into their operations, streamline processes, and improve collaboration both within the organization and with external partners.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services. It is a standard developed by GS1 (formerly the Uniform Code Council) for sharing information about the movement and status of physical objects within a supply chain. EPCIS provides a standardized way of recording and sharing information about product movements and events, such as when a product is shipped, received, or stored.

One of the benefits of EPCIS is improved visibility into supply chain operations. By using EPCIS to track the movement of products throughout the supply chain, businesses can gain real-time insight into where products are and what is happening to them. This information can be used to optimize supply chain operations, improve inventory management, and enhance customer service by providing more accurate information about product availability.

## What is CBV?

CBV stands for Core Business Vocabulary. It is a set of standardized data elements developed by GS1 for use in business transactions. CBV provides a common language for communicating data between trading partners, allowing for greater interoperability and more accurate data exchange.

One of the benefits of CBV is improved collaboration between trading partners. By using a common data language, businesses can communicate more effectively, reducing the risk of miscommunication and errors. This can help to streamline business processes, improve supply chain visibility, and enhance overall efficiency.
