The GS1 Company Prefix is a unique identifier assigned to a company by GS1, and it provides the foundation for the GS1 CBV.

GS1 CBV data is critical for the effective exchange of product information throughout the supply chain. Here are a few key reasons why accurate GS1 CBV data is so important:

## 2. Improved Data Quality

The GS1 CBV provides a standardized framework for the exchange of product information, which helps ensure data accuracy and consistency. This is particularly important in industries with complex supply chains, where consistent and accurate data is essential for efficient operations.
