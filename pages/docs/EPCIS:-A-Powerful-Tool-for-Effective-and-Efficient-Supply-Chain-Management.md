## EPCIS: A Powerful Tool for Effective and Efficient Supply Chain Management

The global supply chain has become increasingly complex, with multiple stakeholders involved in the movement of goods and services from production to the end customer. This complexity has created challenges for businesses to track and trace products, understand their location and status, and ensure compliance with regulations.

To overcome these challenges, businesses are turning to the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS), a standard put forth by GS1, a nonprofit organization that develops and maintains standards for the supply chain industry.

EPCIS is a standard that enables businesses to collect and share real-time information about the movement and status of products across the supply chain. It provides end-to-end visibility and transparency for businesses, allowing them to track and trace products from the point of origin to the point of consumption.

In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of EPCIS for effective and efficient supply chain management, and how it can help businesses to know who, what, when, where, why, and how across the supply chain and business operations.

### What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is an international standard that provides a standard format for sharing data across the supply chain. It uses Electronic Product Codes (EPCs) to uniquely identify products and track their movement across the supply chain.

EPCs are machine-readable codes that are attached to products using RFID or other identification technologies. These codes contain information about the product, such as its batch number, expiration date, and other relevant data, enabling businesses to track the product's location and status in real-time.

EPCIS enables businesses to collect, store, and share data about the movement of products across the supply chain. It provides a common language and format for sharing data, enabling businesses to collaborate seamlessly and make key decisions based on up-to-date information.

### How EPCIS benefits supply chain management

EPCIS offers several benefits for effective and efficient supply chain management. By providing end-to-end visibility and transparency across the supply chain, EPCIS helps businesses to optimize their operations, reduce costs, and ensure compliance with regulations.

#### Improved Visibility and Transparency

EPCIS enables businesses to track and trace products across the supply chain, providing real-time visibility into the movement and status of products. This visibility and transparency enable businesses to optimize their operations, improve their responsiveness to customer demand, and reduce costs by eliminating inefficiencies and waste.

#### Enhanced Collaboration Across Stakeholders

EPCIS provides a common language and format for sharing data across the supply chain. This common language enables stakeholders to collaborate seamlessly, share data, and make key decisions based on up-to-date information. By enhancing collaboration across stakeholders, EPCIS can help businesses to optimize supply chain processes, improve operational efficiency, and reduce costs.

#### Improved Compliance with Regulations

EPCIS provides businesses with the ability to track and trace products across the supply chain, ensuring compliance with regulations. For example, in the pharmaceutical industry, EPCIS can be used to track and trace drugs from the manufacturer to the end customer, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements related to the sale and distribution of pharmaceuticals.

#### Improved Customer Experience

EPCIS provides businesses with real-time visibility into the movement and status of products across the supply chain. This visibility enables businesses to improve their responsiveness to customer demand and provide a better customer experience. By providing customers with up-to-date information about the status of their orders, businesses can improve customer satisfaction and increase loyalty.
