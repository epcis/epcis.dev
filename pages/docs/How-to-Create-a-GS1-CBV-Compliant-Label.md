# How to Create a GS1 CBV Compliant Label

Are you in the process of designing a label for your product that requires compliance with GS1 CBV standards? If so, then this guide is for you. In this post, we'll cover everything you need to know about GS1 CBV standards and how you can create compliant labels.

## What is GS1 CBV?

The Global Standards One (GS1) is a non-profit organization that develops and maintains standards for the identification, communication, and exchange of information between businesses. The Consumer Goods Business Vocabulary (CBV) is just one of the many standards that GS1 has developed to support the needs of the consumer goods industry.

CBV is a common language for product, location, and party information that businesses use to communicate with one another. This uniform vocabulary streamlines communication, which in turn helps businesses operate more efficiently and enables the use of automated processes. Additionally, CBV enables businesses to identify, collect, and share critical product information throughout the supply chain.

The GS1 CBV contains a comprehensive set of standard terms and definitions. These terms help businesses standardize how they describe their products, which in turn helps ensure that their products are properly identified and communicated throughout the supply chain.

## Why is GS1 CBV Compliance Important?

There are a number of reasons why GS1 CBV compliance is important. First,  it helps ensure that products are properly identified and communicated throughout the supply chain. This is critical for a variety of reasons, including product tracking, inventory control, and distribution efficiency.

Second, GS1 CBV compliance enables businesses to effectively communicate product information with their trading partners. By using a common vocabulary, businesses can ensure that all parties involved in the production, distribution, and sale of their products understand the product information being shared.

Third, GS1 CBV compliance is often a requirement for doing business with certain retailers and suppliers. Many large retailers and suppliers require their suppliers to use GS1 standards to ensure the products they receive meet certain standards, are properly identified and are easily integrated into their systems.

Finally, GS1 CBV compliance can also help businesses differentiate their products and make them more attractive to customers. By ensuring that their products are properly identified and communicated throughout the supply chain, businesses can better meet customer expectations, avoid brand damage, and reduce the risk of product recalls.

## How to Create a GS1 CBV Compliant Label

Creating a GS1 CBV compliant label for your product may seem daunting, but with the right information and tools, it can be easy. Here are the steps you need to take to create a compliant label:

### 1. Obtain a GS1 Company Prefix

First, you'll need to obtain a GS1 company prefix. This prefix is a unique identifier that is assigned to your company by GS1. It's used to create a unique Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) for each of your products.

The GTIN is the number that is encoded in the barcode on your product label. It identifies your product and enables retailers, suppliers, and other trading partners to easily identify your product and track it throughout the supply chain.

### 2. Create a GTIN for Your Product

Once you have your GS1 company prefix, you'll need to create a GTIN for each of your products. The GTIN is a 14-digit numerical code that is used to identify your product.

The first few digits of the GTIN are your GS1 company prefix. The remaining digits are unique to each product. When creating a GTIN, there are a few things you'll need to consider:

- The length of your product code: Depending on your GS1 membership, your product code could be between 8 and 14 digits long
- Using leading zeros: If your product code is shorter than 14 digits, you'll need to fill in the remaining digits with leading zeros
- Countries requiring separate GTINs: Some countries require separate GTINs for the same product if it is sold in different packaging sizes, so be sure to check your country's specific requirements
- Reserved GTINs: Certain GTINs are reserved, such as GTINs starting with "00," "01," or "1," and should not be used for product identification purposes

### 3. Define Your Product Attributes

Once you have created your GTIN, you'll need to define the attributes of your product that will be included in your label. These attributes include things like the product name, description, and dimensions.

It's important to ensure that these attributes are accurate and complete so that your products can be properly identified and communicated throughout the supply chain. Many of these attributes are defined in the GS1 CBV, so be sure to review the standards to ensure that your labels are compliant.

### 4. Design Your Label

With your product attributes defined, you can now start designing your label. The design should include all of the required information, such as your company name, the product name, and the GTIN.

Your label should also include the barcode that contains the GTIN. The barcode should be in the appropriate symbology, which is usually either the EAN/UPC symbol or the GS1 DataBar symbol.

In addition to these requirements, you should also consider the layout and design of your label. To ensure that your label is easy to read and scan, consider the following:

- Keep the label uncluttered to help scanning and readability
- Use contrasting colors for the background and barcode to improve scanning
- Ensure that the barcode is at least 32mm wide for a good scan quality
- Place the barcode in a visible location on the product that is easy to access for scanning
- Consider using images or logos to help differentiate your product

### 5. Test Your Label

Before producing a large run of labels, it's important to test them to ensure that they are compliant and will scan properly. One way to do this is to use a barcode scanner to ensure that the barcode scans accurately.

It's also a good idea to test your labels with your trading partners to ensure that they can properly receive and interpret the product information.

## Conclusion

Designing a GS1 CBV compliant label requires attention to detail and careful planning. By following the steps outlined above, you can create a label that is compliant with GS1 standards and will help your products be properly identified and communicated throughout the supply chain.
