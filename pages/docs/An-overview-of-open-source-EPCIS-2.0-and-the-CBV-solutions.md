# An Overview of Open-Source EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV Solutions

As we move towards the digitalization of industries, the need for transparency and interoperability between different systems has become increasingly important. One solution to this problem is the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard, developed by the GS1 organization. 

EPCIS provides a standard way of capturing and sharing supply chain events and product information, allowing for improved visibility and traceability throughout the supply chain. It has been widely adopted by various industries, including retail, healthcare, and transportation.

In this article, we will discuss the open-source EPCIS 2.0 standard and its benefits, as well as the use of the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) in implementing EPCIS solutions.

## An Introduction to EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the EPCIS standard, released in 2018. It provides several enhancements over the previous version, including improved support for data sharing and increased flexibility in data modeling.

EPCIS 2.0 introduces the concept of "Event Data", which allows for the capture of more detailed information about supply chain events. This includes data such as the time and location of an event, as well as contextual information such as the reason for the event or the parties involved.

Another new feature of EPCIS 2.0 is the ability to handle complex hierarchies of objects, such as shipments containing multiple packages or pallets. This allows for more accurate and detailed tracking of products as they move through the supply chain.

Overall, EPCIS 2.0 provides a more robust, flexible, and scalable solution for capturing and sharing supply chain data, making it an ideal choice for organizations looking to improve their supply chain visibility and traceability.

## The Advantages of Open-Source EPCIS 2.0

While there are several commercial EPCIS solutions available, open-source options have also become increasingly popular. Open-source EPCIS 2.0 solutions provide several advantages over their commercial counterparts, including:

### Customizability and Flexibility

Open-source EPCIS solutions are highly customizable and can be tailored to meet specific business requirements. This allows organizations to implement an EPCIS solution that aligns with their specific supply chain processes and data flows.

### Cost Savings

Open-source EPCIS solutions are generally more cost-effective than commercial options, as there are no licensing fees or subscription costs. This makes it an ideal choice for smaller organizations or those with limited budgets.

### Community Support

Open-source EPCIS solutions are supported by a community of developers and users, which provides access to a wealth of knowledge and expertise. This can be invaluable in troubleshooting issues and implementing new features or functionality.

### Interoperability

Open-source EPCIS solutions are designed to be interoperable with other systems and technologies, making it easier to integrate with existing systems and share data with partners and customers.

Overall, open-source EPCIS 2.0 solutions provide a cost-effective, customizable, and flexible alternative to commercial solutions, making it an ideal choice for organizations looking to improve their supply chain visibility and traceability.

## The Role of CBV in EPCIS Implementations

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of standardized terms and definitions developed by GS1 to support the implementation of EPCIS solutions. It provides a common language for describing supply chain events and product information, ensuring consistency and interoperability between different systems.

CBV defines several key concepts that are important in EPCIS implementations, such as "Business Location", "Business Process", and "Product". These concepts are used to describe the various components of a supply chain event and provide a standard way of understanding and interpreting the data.

One of the key benefits of using CBV in EPCIS implementations is the increased interoperability between different systems. By using a common vocabulary, it becomes easier to share data across different systems and technologies, improving overall supply chain visibility and traceability.

CBV can also help to ensure data quality and accuracy by providing a standard way of capturing and sharing data. This helps to reduce errors and inconsistencies in the data, improving the overall reliability of the supply chain data.

## Conclusion

Open-source EPCIS 2.0 solutions, combined with the use of the Core Business Vocabulary, provide a powerful tool for improving supply chain visibility and traceability. By capturing and sharing detailed supply chain event data, organizations can gain insights into their supply chain processes and make more informed decisions.

Open-source options provide a cost-effective, customizable, and flexible alternative to commercial solutions, while CBV ensures consistency and interoperability between different systems.

Overall, the adoption of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is a crucial step towards the digitalization of supply chains, providing a framework for improved transparency and efficiency throughout the supply chain.
