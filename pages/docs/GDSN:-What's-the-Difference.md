# GDSN: What’s the Difference?

In this article, we will be discussing the differences between the GDSN network and other data synchronization networks currently available in the market. GDSN stands for Global Data Synchronization Network and it is a network that has been developed for businesses to communicate product data with each other efficiently.

## What is GDSN?

GDSN is a network that is managed by GS1, a global standard organization that is responsible for developing and maintaining standards that are used in supply chains globally. GDSN is a standardized network that provides a common language for businesses to communicate product information. It was developed to enable businesses to share accurate and up-to-date product information with their trading partners.

## GDSN vs. other data synchronization networks

There are other data synchronization networks available in the market, but they are not as standardized, efficient, or comprehensive as GDSN.

### Non-standardized networks

Some companies use non-standardized networks to communicate product data with their trading partners. These networks are limited in their compatibility with other systems and often require a lot of manual intervention to maintain product data.

This can lead to a number of problems including incomplete or inaccurate product data, delays in getting products to market, and unnecessary costs associated with manual data entry and maintenance.

### Proprietary networks

Some companies develop their proprietary networks that are built to suit their specific needs. These networks are often expensive to develop and maintain and are not compatible with other systems, which can cause a significant amount of time, money, and resources to be spent on integration efforts.

### Comparison with GDSN

GDSN is a standardized network which makes it possible for businesses to communicate product data with each other efficiently. The system is built on a common language that enables businesses to share data in real-time, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

This standardized approach has several advantages over non-standardized and proprietary networks:

- **Efficiency:** Standardization ensures the system is efficient, allowing businesses to communicate data quickly and accurately.
- **Flexibility:** GDSN is flexible and scalable, which means that it can be adapted to suit the needs of businesses and industries of all sizes and types.
- **Accuracy:** The standardized approach means that data sets are consistent, accurate, and complete, reducing errors and increasing the trust between businesses.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Because GDSN is a standardized network, it is less expensive to develop and maintain than proprietary networks, reducing costs for participating businesses.

## How does GDSN work?

GDSN works by enabling businesses to sync their product data with each other in real-time. This is achieved through a network of data pools that are certified by GS1. Data pools act as secure repositories for product data, ensuring that information is consistent and accurate across the network.

Every business that participates in GDSN has a unique identification number called a GTIN, which is used to identify products on the network. When a business decides to publish a new product, they upload the product data to the data pool. This data is then distributed to other businesses in real-time.

When a business receives this product data, they can use it to update their product catalogs automatically. This reduces the need for manual intervention and ensures that product data is up-to-date and accurate.

## Conclusion

GDSN is a global data synchronization network that is revolutionizing how businesses in the supply chain communicate product data with each other. It is a standardized system that ensures that data is consistent, accurate, and complete, reducing errors and increasing trust between businesses.

As companies continue to grow and expand globally, GDSN offers a simple yet effective way to communicate product data that saves time, reduces errors, and lowers costs. By using the global standards set out by GS1, businesses can sync their product data quickly and accurately, enabling them to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive market.
