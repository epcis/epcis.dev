# How EPCIS Enables Real-Time Inventory Management

There is no denying that real-time inventory management is essential for many supply chain operations. Accurately tracking inventory across multiple locations, ensuring stock levels are optimal, and reducing waste all contribute to the bottom line. But how do you achieve real-time inventory management? Enter Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS).

EPCIS is a standardized framework for tracking the movement of physical goods and associated data throughout the supply chain. It allows for automatic tracking of inventory, reducing the need for manual entry, and increasing efficiency. But, how does EPCIS enable real-time inventory management? Let's dive in.

## Improved Visibility

One of the main reasons EPCIS enables real-time inventory management is because it provides improved visibility across the entire supply chain. The framework allows for data sharing, meaning that all parties involved in the supply chain can see the location, movement, and status of inventory. This real-time visibility helps businesses make informed decisions about inventory, such as identifying slow-moving stock, stockouts, or overstocking.

EPCIS also allows for data sharing between different systems, such as warehouse management systems or inventory management systems. By breaking down silos between different systems, businesses can improve inventory accuracy and optimize stock levels. With improved visibility, supply chain stakeholders can make decisions based on accurate data, reducing the risk of stockouts or overstocking.

## Automated Processes

EPCIS enables real-time inventory management by automating processes in the supply chain. By using RFID, barcode scanners, or other tracking technologies, inventory can be tracked automatically, reducing the need for manual entry. Automating processes in this way increases efficiency, reduces errors, and allows for real-time tracking of inventory.

Automated processes enabled by EPCIS also allow for faster decision-making. For example, if a shipment is delayed, businesses can quickly identify inventory that may be affected and make alternative arrangements. This type of rapid decision-making is essential for real-time inventory management, as it enables businesses to respond to changes in demand or supply quickly.

## Improved Traceability

Another way EPCIS enables real-time inventory management is by improving traceability. By using EPCIS, businesses can track every point in the supply chain journey, from manufacturing to the end-user. This tracking provides visibility into where products are at any given time, improving inventory accuracy, and reducing the risk of stockouts or overstocking. Improved traceability also makes it easier to identify and remove defective products from the supply chain, reducing waste.

In addition, EPCIS can enable faster recall times in the event of a product recall. Businesses can use EPCIS to quickly identify which products are affected by a recall and take action to remove the affected products from the supply chain. This type of fast response is essential for ensuring the safety and quality of products in the supply chain.

## Improved Customer Experience

Real-time inventory management enabled by EPCIS also improves the customer experience. By providing accurate inventory information, businesses can reduce the risk of stockouts, reducing customer frustration. Additionally, businesses can optimize stock levels, ensuring that products are available when customers want to buy them. This type of optimized inventory management leads to improved customer satisfaction and increased revenue.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS enables real-time inventory management in several ways. Improved visibility across the supply chain, automated processes, improved traceability, and improved customer experience are all benefits of using EPCIS. Real-time inventory management is essential for many businesses, and EPCIS provides a standardized framework to achieve it. By adopting EPCIS, businesses can improve inventory accuracy, reduce waste, and increase efficiency, leading to increased revenue and improved customer satisfaction. As the world becomes increasingly connected, EPCIS will become an essential tool for supply chain stakeholders looking to achieve real-time inventory management.
