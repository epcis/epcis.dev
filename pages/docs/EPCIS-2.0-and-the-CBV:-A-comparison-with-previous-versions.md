# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV: A comparison with previous versions

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have been around for decades, helping businesses automate their processes and improve productivity. However, these systems only worked effectively within the walls of one company. As businesses began to expand and work with partners, it became clear that a new solution was needed to help manage product information and data sharing. This led to the development of electronic product code information services (EPCIS) standards.

EPCIS 1.0 was first introduced in 2007 as a way to facilitate data sharing between companies using the electronic product code (EPC) standard. However, this version had limited capabilities and was not yet widely adopted. In 2010, EPCIS 1.1 was released with additional features and improvements, resulting in increased adoption.

Fast forward to 2017, and the EPCIS 2.0 standard was introduced. This new version includes significant improvements and updates that help increase interoperability, scalability, and data quality. One of the most significant changes in EPCIS 2.0 is the introduction of the core business vocabulary (CBV).

In this blog post, we will compare EPCIS 2.0 with the previous versions of EPCIS and explore the role of the CBV in this new standard.

## EPCIS 1.0

EPCIS 1.0 was the first version of the standard, and it was designed to support data sharing between companies using the EPC standard. It was created to address the need for a standard format for the exchange of EPC data. Despite its initial promise, EPCIS 1.0 was limited in scope and lacked the necessary functionality for widespread adoption.

One of the limiting factors of EPCIS 1.0 was that it was only designed to support the exchange of EPC data. While this was useful, it was not enough to support large-scale data sharing between companies with different systems and workflows. Additionally, EPCIS 1.0 did not have any specific rules for sharing data, which made it challenging to ensure data quality and consistency.

## EPCIS 1.1

Released in 2010, EPCIS 1.1 was an improvement over its predecessor. It addressed some of the shortcomings of EPCIS 1.0 by adding functionality and features to support more extensive data sharing between companies. EPCIS 1.1 included the ability to share data beyond EPC events, added support for more types of data, and provided more robust rules for data sharing.

Despite these improvements, EPCIS 1.1 was still limited by its lack of support for different data formats and the ability to handle complex data. It was also still challenging to ensure data quality and consistency.

## EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0, released in 2017, was a significant leap forward for the standard. This version introduced several critical updates and changes, including support for different data formats, more robust rules for data sharing, and increased scalability.

One of the most significant changes in EPCIS 2.0 is the introduction of the core business vocabulary (CBV). The CBV is a set of common data elements that define the meaning and context of EPC events. It includes a standardized set of terms and definitions that provide consistency and clarity across different systems and workflows.

The CBV addresses some of the challenges of previous versions by providing a standardized set of terms and definitions that reinforce the semantics of EPC events. This reinforces their meaning and context as they move between different systems and workflows, increasing interoperability and reducing the risk of data interpretation errors.

In addition to the CBV, EPCIS 2.0 includes other improvements, such as better support for complex data structures, simplification of data sharing rules, and support for data-level security. These changes help make EPCIS 2.0 more flexible, versatile, and powerful than its predecessors.

## The role of the CBV

The CBV is an essential component of EPCIS 2.0, providing a standardized set of terms and definitions that ensure data consistency and clarity. It helps reinforce the meaning and context of EPC events, reducing the risk of interpretation errors as data moves between systems and workflows.

The CBV also facilitates increased interoperability by providing a common language across different systems and workflows. This language helps ensure that data is shared and interpreted correctly, regardless of the company or organization involved.

By using the CBV in conjunction with EPCIS 2.0, companies can achieve increased scalability, flexibility, and data quality. This means that they can more effectively manage their product information and collaborate with partners, resulting in increased productivity and cost savings.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS 2.0 is a significant update to the EPCIS standard, providing increased scalability, flexibility, and data quality. The introduction of the CBV is a critical component of this new standard, providing a standardized set of terms and definitions that reinforce the meaning and context of EPC events.

While previous versions of EPCIS had limitations in terms of data sharing, data quality, and interoperability, EPCIS 2.0 addresses these issues head-on. By using this standard, companies can more effectively manage their product information and collaborate with partners, resulting in increased productivity and cost savings.

The CBV plays a vital role in the success of EPCIS 2.0, providing a consistent language that ensures data consistency and clarity across different systems and workflows. Companies that adopt EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can achieve significant benefits compared to previous versions, and it is clear that the future of data sharing and management will rely on these standards.
