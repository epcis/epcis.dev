# EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps: A Tool for Enterprise-Wide Integration

As businesses grow, so does the complexity of their supply chains. With multiple partners and stakeholders involved in every stage of the process, it can be challenging to manage and monitor the flow of goods and information. To address these issues, the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard was developed to provide a way for companies to track and trace their products across the supply chain.

Recently, EPCIS 2.0 was released, bringing with it a range of new features and improvements. One of the most significant additions to the standard is the concept of BizSteps, a tool that enables enterprise-wide integration by providing a framework for managing and sharing information at every step of the supply chain.

## What are BizSteps?

A BizStep is a specific stage or process within a supply chain, such as receiving, packing, shipping, and so on. By defining each step in this way, it becomes possible to track and trace goods as they move through the supply chain, as well as the information that accompanies them.

With BizSteps, companies can track not only their own internal processes but also those of their partners and suppliers. This level of visibility is essential for effective supply chain management, as it enables businesses to identify bottlenecks, delays, and other issues that may impact the delivery of goods.

## The Benefits of BizSteps

There are many benefits to using BizSteps within the EPCIS 2.0 framework. These include:

### Improved visibility and transparency:
By defining each step of the supply chain as a BizStep, it becomes possible to track and trace products from start to finish. This level of visibility enables businesses to identify issues and bottlenecks, as well as optimize processes where necessary.

### Better collaboration:
As BizSteps are defined across multiple partners and stakeholders, it becomes possible to collaborate more effectively and share information in real-time. This level of collaboration is essential for supply chain management in today's fast-paced business environment.

### Greater efficiency:
By optimizing each BizStep in the supply chain, it becomes possible to reduce costs, save time, and increase efficiency. This level of optimization is critical for businesses that want to remain competitive and grow over time.

### Improved compliance:
With BizSteps, it becomes possible to ensure compliance with various regulations and standards. By tracking and tracing products and information across the supply chain, businesses can demonstrate compliance with regulations such as the FDA's Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).

### Better customer service:
By optimizing BizSteps, it becomes possible to provide better customer service. By reducing errors and delays in the supply chain, businesses can ensure that products are delivered to customers more quickly and efficiently.

## Implementing BizSteps in EPCIS 2.0

Implementing BizSteps within the EPCIS 2.0 framework requires a few key steps. These include:

### Defining each BizStep:
The first step is to define each BizStep within the supply chain. This involves identifying each process, such as receiving, packing, and shipping, and assigning a unique identifier to each step.

### Mapping the supply chain:
The next step is to map the entire supply chain, from start to finish. This involves identifying all partners and stakeholders involved in each BizStep and documenting the information and products that flow through each step.

### Integrating data sources:
The third step is to integrate all data sources into EPCIS 2.0. This includes data from partners, suppliers, and other sources, such as IoT devices, sensors, and RFID tags.

### Monitoring and optimizing BizSteps:
Once BizSteps have been implemented, it is essential to monitor and optimize each step continually. This involves analyzing data, identifying issues, and implementing improvements where necessary.

## Conclusion

BizSteps within the EPCIS 2.0 framework provide a powerful tool for supply chain management, enabling businesses to track and trace products and information across the supply chain in real-time. By defining each step of the process and integrating data sources, businesses can optimize each stage of the supply chain, reducing costs, increasing efficiency and improving customer service.

Implementing BizSteps requires careful planning and execution, but the benefits are significant. As businesses look to remain competitive and grow in today's fast-paced business environment, tools like BizSteps are critical for success.
