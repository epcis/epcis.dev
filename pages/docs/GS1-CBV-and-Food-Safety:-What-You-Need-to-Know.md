# GS1 CBV and Food Safety: What You Need to Know 

The Global Standards One (GS1) Company is a not-for-profit organization that is dedicated to enhancing the efficiency and transparency of the supply chain, especially when it comes to goods distribution. One of its latest innovations in the food sector is the GS1 Certified Barcode Verification (CBV) program, which has been designed to help companies comply with the food safety standards that are set by various regulatory bodies around the world. In this blog post, we are going to discuss what GS1 CBV is, how it works, and what it means for food safety.

## What is GS1 CBV? 

GS1 CBV is a certification program that was developed to provide food companies with an effective way of ensuring that their products meet the international barcode standards that have been set by GS1. A significant objective of this program is food safety, which is an important issue that has become a growing concern among consumers worldwide. The CBV program aims to guarantee that the trade items are labeled with barcodes that are in compliance with GS1 standards, which is a critical factor in ensuring food safety.

## How Does GS1 CBV Work? 

The CBV program is designed to verify that a barcode can be scanned by a scanner, and read by a software interpreting the encoded data. In addition, it must be assured that the barcode data matches the compliance for the integrated barcode interpretation software. The main objective of the GS1 CBV program is to confirm that the barcode on a food package can be read accurately by any universal barcode scanner. The barcode must contain all the necessary data that is required for proper identification of the product, such as the product name, lot number, expiration date and other important data. Barcode verification is one of the essential requirements for compliance with global regulatory bodies.

Companies must apply for GS1 CBV from any of the authorized solution providers, who must demonstrate that they have undergone the relevant training to be authorized as a CBV supplier. Once authorized, they will be able to offer certification services for clients who have decided to obtain GS1 CBV certificate for their barcodes. After verification, the supplier should provide an online report that should include a pass/fail summary, a graphical analysis report on line contrast, modulation and magnification, and a detailed report on LQC/UPC barcode, data accuracy, GS1 identification keys content and encoding standards accordance.

## What Does it Mean for Food Safety? 

The GS1 CBV program plays a critical role in ensuring food safety. Barcode verification is an essential step in the distribution of food products because it reduces the risk of errors and inaccuracies in the identification and traceability of a given product. The CBV program helps to reduce the errors that could have otherwise gone unnoticed, such as the wrong use of a packaging material or an incorrect label for a product. It ensures that the product information contained in the barcode is consistent and accurate, which in turn reduces the safety risk associated with product recalls or errors in tracking products through the supply chain.

Furthermore, barcode verification is one of the critical links in the food safety chain. Many countries have regulatory requirements for product identification and safety that use barcodes to monitor the movement of goods from production to the point of sale. The CBV program helps companies to ensure that their barcodes meet the essential requirements of those regulatory bodies, which in turn helps these companies to avoid regulatory penalties, as well as reducing the risk of product recalls, thereby securing the brandâ€™s reputation.

## Conclusion

The GS1 CBV program is an essential element in ensuring food safety in the food industry. It provides the assurance that the barcode on a food package can be read accurately by any universal barcode scanner. The certification process is provided by authorized solution providers, who perform thorough verification for compliance with GS1 standards. Barcode verification is critical in reducing errors and improving the accuracy and consistency of product information, which in turn reduces the risk of errors in tracking products through the supply chain. The use of CBV certification can not only help companies to meet the regulatory requirements, but it can also help them to avoid any penalties and reduce the risk associated with product recalls, thereby securing their brand reputation.
