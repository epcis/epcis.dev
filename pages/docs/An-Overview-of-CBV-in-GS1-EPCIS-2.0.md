# An Overview of CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0

CBV, or "Core Business Vocabulary," is a term that has been used in various contexts, but its relevance to the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is undeniable. GS1 is an organization that develops and promotes standards for supply chain management, and EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a standard that enables real-time or near-real-time visibility into the movement of goods across the supply chain. In this blog post, we will provide an introduction to CBV in the context of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and explore its components in detail.

## Introduction

CBV is a set of data elements that are foundational to any supply chain management system. As a standardized vocabulary, CBV ensures that data is consistent and meaningful across different organizations and systems. The use of CBV in supply chain management facilitates interoperability, reduces errors, and enhances data analysis capabilities. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is an advanced model for implementing CBV in real-world supply chain applications.

The GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard provides a way to capture, share, and query detailed information about the location, status, and movement of products in the supply chain. It enables trading partners to share data in a standardized format, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of their operations. The EPCIS 2.0 standard leverages CBV to achieve these objectives, ensuring that data is precise and consistent across different systems and organizations.

## Components of CBV

The CBV used in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is composed of four different types of elements:

### Object Event

Object events are the primary events in the EPCIS standard. They describe the change in state or location of a physical object in the supply chain. Object events are identified by the EPC code assigned to the object, which is a unique identifier that enables tracking of the object throughout the supply chain. Object events typically include information such as the location of an object, the time it was scanned or read, and its current state (e.g., in transit, received, etc.).

### Aggregation Event

Aggregation events describe the relationships between objects within the supply chain. They are used to track the movements of groups of objects, such as cases, pallets, or shipments. Aggregation events are identified by the EPC code assigned to the group of objects, which is a unique identifier that enables tracking of the group of objects throughout the supply chain. Aggregation events typically include information such as the number of objects in the group, the location of the group, the time it was scanned or read, and its current state.

### Transaction Event

Transaction events are used to track the flow of information or money within the supply chain. They describe the exchange of ownership, possession, or control of objects or groups of objects. Transaction events are identified by the transaction ID, which is a unique identifier that enables tracking of the flow of information or money throughout the supply chain. Transaction events typically include information such as the amount of money exchanged, the date and time it occurred, and the parties involved.

### Transformation Event

Transformation events describe changes to objects or groups of objects within the supply chain. They are used to track the transformation of objects from one form to another, such as the transformation of raw materials into finished products. Transformation events are identified by the transformation ID, which is a unique identifier that enables tracking of the transformation throughout the supply chain. Transformation events typically include information such as the original and transformed objects, the location where the transformation occurred, and the time it occurred.

## Benefits of CBV

The use of CBV in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 provides several benefits for supply chain management systems:

### Enhanced Interoperability

CBV ensures that data is standardized across different systems and organizations. This means that data can be easily shared and understood, improving interoperability between trading partners.

### Reduced Errors

CBV reduces the likelihood of errors in data entry and analysis. By providing a standardized vocabulary for data, CBV eliminates ambiguity and ensures that data is consistent and accurate.

### Improved Data Analysis

CBV enables more detailed and nuanced data analysis. With a standard set of data elements, supply chain managers can more easily analyze data across different systems and organizations, enabling more informed decision-making.

### Increased Efficiency

CBV enables supply chain managers to share data more quickly and accurately. This can lead to efficiencies in supply chain operations, reducing costs and increasing profitability.

## Conclusion

CBV is a foundational element of GS1 EPCIS 2.0, providing a standardized vocabulary for data elements in supply chain management systems. The use of CBV in EPCIS 2.0 enables real-time or near-real-time visibility into the movement of goods across the supply chain, enabling enhanced interoperability, reduced errors, improved data analysis, and increased efficiency. Understanding the components of CBV and its benefits is essential for any organization seeking to improve its supply chain operations through the use of advanced technology and standardized data elements.
