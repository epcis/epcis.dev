# EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV applications in retail industry

In today's world, retail industry is at the forefront of the economy. With increasing competition, retailers require a high level of visibility into their supply chain to remain competitive. This is where Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) comes in. In this blog post, we will explain what EPCIS 2.0 is and how it is used in the retail industry, as well as how the CBV can help businesses in this sector.

## EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is an international standard used for sharing information about the movement and status of physical products, from manufacturing through the supply chain and to the end customer. It was first introduced in 2007 and is now in its second version. EPCIS 2.0 defines a standard data model and message format for capturing and sharing information related to a product's lifecycle.

The EPCIS 2.0 standard is especially useful for the retail industry, as it enables retailers to have a high degree of visibility into their supply chain. This enables retailers to track products at each stage of the supply chain, from production to delivery. By doing so, it allows them to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the overall customer experience.

One of the key benefits of EPCIS 2.0 is that it is an open standard, meaning that it can be used by any company or organization, regardless of their size or industry. This makes it an ideal solution for the retail industry, as retailers operate in a complex ecosystem with many different suppliers, distributors, and other partners.

## CBV

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of standard terms and definitions that can be used to describe the products and processes in the retail industry. It is a key component of EPCIS 2.0 and is used to ensure that information is consistently understood and interpreted throughout the supply chain.

The CBV includes a set of terms and definitions that describe the key elements of a product's lifecycle, such as the manufacturer, the production date, and the expiration date. It also includes terms that describe the different stages of the supply chain, such as shipping and receiving.

By using the CBV, retailers can ensure that everyone in the supply chain has a common understanding of the products and processes involved. This helps to reduce errors and improve overall efficiency, as everyone is on the same page.

## Applications in retail industry

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have a wide range of applications in the retail industry. One of the most important is improved supply chain visibility. By using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, retailers can track products at every stage of the supply chain, from production to delivery. This helps to identify bottlenecks and other inefficiencies, allowing retailers to make adjustments and improve overall efficiency.

Another important application of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV is improved inventory management. By tracking products at each stage of the supply chain, retailers can ensure that they always have the right products on hand. This can help to reduce waste and improve overall profitability.

Finally, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can help retailers to improve the overall customer experience. By having a high degree of visibility into the supply chain, retailers can provide customers with accurate information about product availability, delivery times, and more. This can help to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV are powerful tools for the retail industry. By providing improved supply chain visibility, inventory management, and customer experience, they can help retailers to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
