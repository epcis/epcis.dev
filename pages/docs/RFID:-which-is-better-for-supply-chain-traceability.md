# RFID: Which is Better for Supply Chain Traceability?

As technology continues to advance, more and more businesses are looking for ways to improve their supply chain management processes. One technology that has gained popularity in recent years is radio-frequency identification (RFID). RFID involves the use of radio waves to track and identify objects, allowing businesses to easily monitor and manage their inventory in real-time.

While RFID technology has proven to be effective in enhancing supply chain traceability, there are different types of RFID technologies available on the market. This has led to the question of which type of RFID technology is better for supply chain traceability. In this blog post, we’ll explore two types of RFID technologies: passive and active RFID, and examine which is better for supply chain traceability.

## What is Passive RFID?

Passive RFID is a type of RFID technology that operates using radio waves. It is called “passive” because it does not have an internal power source, but rather receives power from an external reader. When a passive RFID tag is scanned by a reader, it emits a signal that contains information about the product it is attached to. Passive RFID tags are relatively inexpensive, small in size, and can be easily attached to products.

## What is Active RFID?

Active RFID is a more sophisticated type of RFID technology that has an internal power source. This means that it does not rely on an external reader for power. Active RFID tags are equipped with a battery and are able to emit their own signal. This makes them more powerful than passive RFID tags and allows them to transmit data over longer distances. Active RFID tags are also able to store more information than passive RFID tags.

## Which is Better for Supply Chain Traceability: Passive or Active RFID?

When it comes to supply chain traceability, both passive and active RFID technologies have their advantages and limitations. Here are some of the factors to consider:

### Cost

One of the biggest advantages of passive RFID technology is cost. Passive tags are much less expensive than active tags, making them an ideal solution for businesses that need to track large volumes of products. On the other hand, active RFID tags are more expensive, but they offer additional functionality that can provide value in certain supply chain applications.

### Range

Active RFID tags have a much longer range than passive RFID tags. This means that they can be used to track products over long distances, which is useful in applications where products are moving across large areas. Passive RFID tags, on the other hand, have a shorter range and are better suited to applications where products are being tracked over smaller distances.

### Data Storage

Active RFID tags have the ability to store more data than passive RFID tags. This means that they can be used to track detailed information about products, such as temperature and humidity levels. Passive RFID tags, on the other hand, are better suited to tracking basic information, such as product ID and location.

### Battery Life

Active RFID tags have an internal battery that provides power to the tag. This means that they have a limited battery life, typically several years. Once the battery life is depleted, the tag must be replaced. Passive RFID tags, on the other hand, do not have an internal battery and can last for many years without needing to be replaced.

## Conclusion

When it comes to supply chain traceability, both passive and active RFID technologies have their advantages and limitations. Ultimately, the choice of which technology to use will depend on the specific needs of the business. Passive RFID tags are ideal for applications where cost is a concern and products are being tracked over shorter distances. Active RFID tags, on the other hand, are ideal for applications where longer range tracking and more detailed information is necessary.

Regardless of the type of RFID technology used, it is important to ensure that the RFID system is compatible with the Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS) across the supply chain. EPCIS is a standardized framework for sharing information across the supply chain, making it easier for businesses to track and manage their inventory.

In summary, both passive and active RFID technologies can provide value in enhancing supply chain traceability. The choice of which technology to use will depend on the specific needs of the business. However, it is important to ensure that the RFID system is compatible with EPCIS to maximize the benefits of supply chain traceability.
