# **What is EPCIS and how does it work in the Supply Chain?**

The world we live in today is more interconnected than ever before. Every product that we buy, every service that we consume, and every action that we take has some impact on the global supply chain. With this level of interconnectedness, it’s critical that we have systems in place that enable us to track and trace products as they move across the supply chain.

EPCIS, or Electronic Product Code Information Services, is one such system that plays a critical role in enabling end-to-end supply chain visibility. In this blog post, we’ll dive into EPCIS, what it is, how it works, and its impact on the supply chain.

## **What is EPCIS?**

EPCIS is an industry standard created by GS1, a leading global organization dedicated to the design and implementation of standards-based solutions for the supply chain. EPCIS provides a standardized way to capture and share information about the movement of products across the supply chain. This information includes information about the location of a product, its condition, and its movement history.

At its core, EPCIS is designed to enable end-to-end supply chain visibility. By capturing and sharing information about the movement of products, EPCIS enables businesses to track and trace products as they move across the supply chain. This enables businesses to respond quickly to any issues that arise in the supply chain, reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions and improving overall supply chain efficiency.

## **How does EPCIS work?**

To better understand how EPCIS works, it’s important to know that it’s built on a foundation of GS1 standards. These standards provide a basis for the unique identification of products, locations, and other entities across the supply chain.

EPCIS uses a three-tier architecture to capture and share information about the movement of products. The three tiers are:

* Capture
* Repository
* Query

### **Capture**

The capture tier is responsible for capturing information about the movement of products across the supply chain. This includes information such as the location of a product, its condition, and its movement history. This information is captured using a variety of technologies, such as RFID tags, barcodes, and GPS.

### **Repository**

Once the information has been captured, it is stored within a repository. The repository serves as a centralized database that contains information about the movement of products across the supply chain. This information can be accessed by authorized parties to track and trace products as they move across the supply chain.

### **Query**

The query tier provides a way for authorized parties to access the information stored within the repository. This information can be accessed in real-time, enabling businesses to quickly respond to any issues that arise in the supply chain.

## **The Impact of EPCIS on the Supply Chain**

The impact of EPCIS on the supply chain cannot be overstated. By enabling end-to-end visibility, EPCIS has transformed the way that businesses are able to manage their supply chains. Here are a few key ways that EPCIS has impacted the supply chain:

### **Increased Efficiency**

EPCIS enables businesses to manage their supply chains more efficiently. By capturing and sharing information about the movement of products, businesses are able to streamline their supply chain processes and reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions.

### **Improved Visibility**

EPCIS provides businesses with greater visibility into the movement of products across the supply chain. This enables businesses to track and trace products in real-time, reducing the risk of lost or stolen products and enabling businesses to quickly respond to any issues that arise in the supply chain.

### **Improved Customer Experience**

By enabling businesses to manage their supply chains more efficiently and with greater visibility, EPCIS ultimately improves the customer experience. By reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions, businesses are able to deliver products to customers more quickly and with greater reliability.

## **Conclusion**

EPCIS is a critical system in enabling supply chain visibility. By providing a standardized way to capture and share information about the movement of products across the supply chain, EPCIS enables businesses to track and trace products in real-time, reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions, and ultimately enhance the customer experience. As businesses continue to navigate an ever-changing global supply chain landscape, solutions like EPCIS will play an increasingly critical role in enabling businesses to manage their supply chains more effectively.
