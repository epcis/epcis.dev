# EPCIS and Sensors: A Winning Combination for Supply Chain Monitoring

The global supply chain is an incredibly complex network of individuals, companies, and technologies, all working together to get products from point A to point B. One of the biggest challenges facing supply chain managers is the ability to effectively monitor and track goods as they move through the supply chain. This is where EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) and sensors come in. Together, these technologies provide a powerful tool for tracking goods, optimizing the supply chain and improving transparency and efficiency.

## The Role of Sensors in the Supply Chain

Sensors are small devices that can be attached to a wide range of products and can be used to track everything from location to humidity levels. There are several different types of sensors, including GPS, temperature, and humidity sensors, each with its own unique set of benefits and applications.

When it comes to supply chain management, sensors can be incredibly useful in several different ways. First and foremost, they provide real-time data on the location and condition of goods. This can help supply chain managers to identify potential issues before they become major problems, including theft, damage, and delays.

Another key benefit of sensors is their ability to provide data on the environmental conditions that goods are exposed to during transport. For example, temperature sensors can be used to monitor the temperature of products, ensuring that they are not exposed to temperatures that are too high or too low during transport. This can be particularly important for products that are sensitive to temperature changes, such as food and pharmaceuticals.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a globally recognized standard for exchanging information about the movement and status of goods in the supply chain. It provides a standardized method for recording and sharing data about products as they move through the supply chain, including information about where the product came from, where it is now, and where it is going next.

EPCIS is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing it to be used across a wide range of industries and supply chain types. It is a key component of many supply chain management systems, providing supply chain managers with the information they need to make informed decisions about product movement, shipment scheduling, and inventory management.

## Why EPCIS and Sensors Are a Winning Combination

Sensors and EPCIS are a winning combination for several different reasons. First and foremost, sensors provide real-time data that can be recorded and shared using the EPCIS standard. This means that supply chain managers can easily track goods as they move through the supply chain, ensuring that they are staying on schedule and remaining in good condition.

Another key benefit of the combination of EPCIS and sensors is improved visibility into the supply chain. By using sensors to track goods and EPCIS to record and share data, supply chain managers can gain a more complete picture of the supply chain, identifying potential bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and risks before they become major problems.

Finally, the combination of EPCIS and sensors can help to improve transparency and traceability within the supply chain. By using sensors to track goods and EPCIS to record and share data, companies can provide customers with more detailed information about the products they are purchasing. This can be particularly important for industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, where there is a high degree of regulatory oversight and concern over product safety.

## Case Study: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Monitoring

One industry where the combination of EPCIS and sensors is already being used to great effect is the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical products are highly regulated, and there is a need for strict control over the movement and condition of products as they move through the supply chain.

By using sensors to track products and EPCIS to record and share data, pharmaceutical companies can improve their ability to track products and ensure that they are being transported under appropriate conditions. For example, temperature sensors can be used to monitor the temperature of products, ensuring that they are not exposed to temperatures that are too high or too low.

This improved monitoring capability can help to reduce the risk of product damage or spoilage, which in turn can help to reduce the risk of product recalls, lower insurance costs and reduce the overall cost of the pharmaceutical supply chain.

## Conclusion

The combination of EPCIS and sensors provides a powerful tool for supply chain managers who are looking for ways to improve supply chain efficiency, transparency, and visibility. By using sensors to track goods and EPCIS to record and share data, supply chain managers can identify potential issues before they become major problems, improve transparency and traceability within the supply chain, and improve customer satisfaction.

While the use of EPCIS and sensors is already widespread in several industries, there is still significant potential for growth in other sectors. As more companies recognize the benefits of this winning combination, we can expect to see even greater innovation and collaboration within the supply chain, leading to a more efficient, transparent, and profitable global supply chain.
