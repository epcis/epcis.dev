# EPCIS and CBV for Real-time Business Insights

Businesses rely heavily on obtaining real-time insights to help make informed decisions that can result in improved efficiency, increased profits, and a better customer experience. However, obtaining such insights in real-time can be challenging, especially when it comes to managing complex supply chains that involve multiple stakeholders, departments, and data systems. 

Enter Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), two technologies that are being increasingly adopted by businesses across sectors as part of their digital transformation journey, which are enabling organizations to obtain real-time business insights.

In this blog, we will elaborate what EPCIS and CBV are, how they work together to provide real-time insights, and the benefits of using these technologies for businesses.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is an industry-standard data exchange format that provides a standardized way for businesses to share data related to the movement of goods across the supply chain. Developed by GS1, a global standards organization, EPCIS allows participants in the supply chain to capture and share real-time information about the movement of goods, including when and where they were produced, shipped, received, and even disposed of.

When used in conjunction with radio-frequency identification (RFID) and internet of things (IoT) sensors, EPCIS can capture data about an object's location, temperature, humidity, and other factors, which can provide valuable insights to businesses regarding the quality and condition of their products as they move through the supply chain.

## What is CBV?

CBV, on the other hand, is a standardized vocabulary of terms that businesses use to describe the various aspects of their operations, including products, locations, and organizational structures. Developed by the Open Applications Group (OAGi), a non-profit consortium of software developers, CBV provides a common language that businesses can use to share information that would otherwise be difficult to interpret across different software systems.

For example, CBV provides a standardized way for businesses to describe the different attributes of a particular product or service, such as its weight, price, and size. By using CBV, businesses can ensure that everyone involved in the supply chain is using the same terminology, which can help to prevent miscommunications or misunderstandings.

## How EPCIS and CBV Work Together

While EPCIS and CBV are different technologies, they work together to provide businesses with valuable real-time insights into their supply chain operations.

When a business uses EPCIS to capture data about the movement of goods across the supply chain, it can use CBV to classify that data according to a standardized vocabulary of terms. For example, a company might use EPCIS to capture data about shipments of a particular product across multiple locations, and then use CBV to classify that data according to the product's specific attributes, such as its size, weight, and price.

By combining EPCIS and CBV in this way, businesses can obtain real-time insights into the movement of goods across the supply chain, including information about how long it takes for products to move from one location to another, the quality of the products at different stages of the supply chain, and even how customers are using the products once they purchase them.

## Benefits of using EPCIS and CBV for Real-time Business Insights

There are numerous benefits to using EPCIS and CBV for real-time insights in businesses:

### Improved supply chain visibility

By using EPCIS and CBV to capture and classify data about the movement of goods across the supply chain, businesses can obtain a much clearer picture of how their products are moving through the supply chain, and where potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies might be occurring.

### Reduced inventory costs

Real-time insights obtained through EPCIS and CBV can help businesses to optimize their inventory levels, by providing data about which products are selling quickly and which are not. By using this data to adjust their inventory levels in real time, businesses can reduce the costs associated with inventory management.

### Enhanced customer service

By using EPCIS and CBV to track shipments of products across the supply chain, businesses can provide their customers with more accurate estimates of when their products will arrive, as well as provide updates about any potential delays. This can help to enhance customer satisfaction and build brand loyalty.

### Improved operational efficiency

Real-time insights obtained through EPCIS and CBV can help businesses to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in their operations, such as delays in shipping or receiving products. By using this data to optimize their processes, businesses can reduce costs and improve efficiency.

## Conclusion

EPCIS and CBV are two critical technologies that are enabling businesses to obtain valuable real-time insights into their supply chain operations. By using these technologies to capture, classify, and share data across stakeholders, businesses can gain improved visibility into their operations, reduce inventory costs, enhance customer service, and improve operational efficiency.

As more businesses adopt these technologies as part of their digital transformation journey, we can expect to see continued innovation and advancements in the capabilities of EPCIS and CBV, further enabling businesses to achieve their goals and drive success in today's ever-evolving business landscape.
