# Why EPCIS and CBV are essential for Business Transformation in the digital age

The digital age has brought about significant changes in the way businesses operate. The increased use of technology has made it easier for companies to collect and analyze data, which in turn has revolutionized the way they make decisions. However, most companies struggle with ensuring that their data is accurate, reliable, and secure. This is where EPCIS and CBV come in. In this blog post, we will explore why these two technologies are essential for business transformation in the digital age.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services. It is a standardized format for sharing information about the movement and location of goods within the supply chain. EPCIS provides a standard framework for capturing events related to the movement of goods, such as shipping, receiving, and inventory adjustments.

The standardization of EPCIS makes it easier for businesses to share information with their partners and customers. Since EPCIS is based on a standardized format, it ensures that all parties involved in the supply chain speak the same language, reducing the risk of miscommunication and errors.

## What is CBV?

CBV stands for Core Business Vocabulary. It is a standardized framework for describing business processes, transactions, and data. CBV provides a common language for describing business processes that are critical to supply chain management.

CBV is designed to be used alongside EPCIS, providing a common vocabulary for describing the events captured by EPCIS. The combination of EPCIS and CBV provides a standardized framework for describing the movement and location of goods, as well as the business processes that accompany those events.

## Why are EPCIS and CBV essential for Business Transformation?

EPCIS and CBV are essential for business transformation because they enable companies to make better decisions based on accurate and reliable data. By providing a standardized framework for describing the movement and location of goods, as well as the business processes that accompany those events, EPCIS and CBV help companies to:

### 1. Gain better visibility into their supply chain

EPCIS and CBV provide companies with better visibility into their supply chain. By capturing and sharing information about the movement and location of goods, companies can better understand where their products are at any given time, and how long it will take for them to arrive at their destination.

### 2. Improve collaboration with partners and customers

Since EPCIS and CBV provide a common language for describing the movement and location of goods, as well as the business processes that accompany those events, they enable better collaboration between companies, their partners, and their customers. By using a common language, companies can reduce the risk of miscommunication and errors, and work more efficiently with their partners and customers.

### 3. Increase efficiency and reduce costs

EPCIS and CBV can help companies to increase efficiency and reduce costs by providing better visibility into their supply chain, improving collaboration with partners and customers, and enabling better decision-making based on accurate and reliable data. By streamlining their supply chain and improving communication with their partners and customers, companies can reduce the time and resources required to move goods through the supply chain.

### 4. Improve customer satisfaction

By providing better visibility into the movement and location of goods, EPCIS and CBV can help companies to improve customer satisfaction. Customers are often frustrated by the lack of transparency in the supply chain, and by using EPCIS and CBV, companies can provide real-time updates on the location of goods, and provide better estimates of when those goods will arrive.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS and CBV are essential for business transformation in the digital age. By providing a standardized framework for describing the movement and location of goods, as well as the business processes that accompany those events, EPCIS and CBV enable companies to make better decisions based on accurate and reliable data. They provide better visibility into the supply chain, improve collaboration with partners and customers, increase efficiency and reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. As companies continue to navigate the challenges of the digital age, EPCIS and CBV will become increasingly important tools for driving business transformation and success.
