# EPCIS and CBV for Sustainable Business Growth

As the world becomes more interconnected, businesses are looking for ways to track products and materials through their supply chains. One solution gaining in popularity is the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) standards. These standards can help companies improve supply chain visibility, which can lead to better decision making and ultimately help businesses become more sustainable.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard for capturing and sharing information about supply chain events. It uses a data model that captures information about objects, such as products or materials, and the events that relate to those objects. For example, EPCIS can capture information about when a product was manufactured, where it was shipped, and when it was received by a customer.

## What is CBV?

CBV is a set of standard terms and definitions that can be used by any industry to describe their products and services. It provides a common language that can be used to communicate information about products and services throughout the supply chain. CBV can be used in conjunction with EPCIS to help ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of what is being tracked and shared.

## How can EPCIS and CBV help businesses become more sustainable?

One of the main benefits of EPCIS and CBV is improved supply chain visibility. By capturing and sharing information about supply chain events, businesses can gain insights into their operations and identify areas where they can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and minimize their environmental impact.

For example, a business that uses EPCIS and CBV might be able to identify where waste is being generated in their supply chain. They could then work with suppliers and partners to reduce the amount of waste being generated and track their progress over time. By doing so, they can reduce their environmental impact and potentially save money on disposal costs.

Another way that EPCIS and CBV can help businesses become more sustainable is by enabling them to make more informed decisions about their products and services. By having access to information about their products throughout the supply chain, businesses can identify areas where they can make improvements to reduce their environmental impact.

For example, a business that sells clothing might use EPCIS and CBV to track the materials used in their products. They could then identify which materials are most environmentally friendly and work with their suppliers to source more sustainable materials. Additionally, they could use this information to communicate to their customers about the environmental impact of their products and gain a competitive advantage.

## How can businesses implement EPCIS and CBV?

Before implementing EPCIS and CBV, businesses need to determine what data they want to capture and share, and ensure that they have the necessary infrastructure in place to do so. This can involve setting policies for data sharing and ensuring that all stakeholders are on board with the implementation plan.

Once the infrastructure is in place, businesses can begin capturing and sharing data using EPCIS and CBV. This might involve working with suppliers and partners to capture information about products and materials, and developing processes for sharing this information throughout the supply chain.

There are a number of technology vendors that offer EPCIS and CBV solutions, and businesses may want to work with a vendor that has experience in their industry or specific use case. Additionally, some industries may have their own EPCIS and CBV implementation guidelines, which businesses should be aware of as they implement these standards.

## Conclusion

EPCIS and CBV offer businesses a way to improve supply chain visibility, which can lead to better decision making and increased sustainability. By capturing and sharing information about supply chain events, businesses can identify areas where they can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and minimize their environmental impact. Additionally, by using CBV to standardize product and service descriptions, businesses can communicate more effectively with suppliers, partners and customers, creating transparency and potentially driving sales growth.

As businesses increasingly look for ways to become more sustainable, EPCIS and CBV represent a valuable tool in achieving this goal. By implementing these standards, businesses can help to create more efficient and sustainable supply chains, improve customer satisfaction, and drive long-term growth.
