# Managing Recalls with EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

Recalls can be a daunting task for any business, as they often involve large quantities of products being returned and replaced. Additionally, they come with potential legal, financial, and reputational risks. This is where track and trace technologies like EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can prove to be invaluable in efficiently and effectively managing the recall process.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard, which is designed to provide a standardized way of capturing and sharing data about the movement of products across the supply chain. This data can include information about product location, status, and events such as shipments, receptions, and changes in ownership.

The primary goal of EPCIS 2.0 is to enable real-time visibility and transparency across the supply chain, by allowing different parties to access and share relevant data in a secure and standardized way. This can help to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.

## What is the CBV?

The CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a set of standardized terms and definitions that are used within the EPCIS 2.0 framework to describe and identify different types of events and objects within the supply chain. This includes entities such as products, shipments, and locations, as well as events such as receiving, shipping, and handling.

By using a common vocabulary, different parties within the supply chain can more easily understand and interpret the data being shared through EPCIS 2.0. This helps to reduce errors and misunderstandings and facilitates more effective collaboration and data sharing.

## How can EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV help with recalls?

Recalls can be a complex and time-consuming process, as they involve tracking down and locating potentially thousands or even millions of products that may be affected by a safety issue or defect. However, with the help of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, this process can be significantly streamlined and simplified.

One key benefit of EPCIS 2.0 is that it provides real-time visibility into the movement of products across the supply chain. This means that if a safety issue or defect is identified, affected products can be quickly located and tracked back to their origin. This helps to minimize the number of products that need to be recalled and reduces the risk of further harm to consumers.

The CBV adds an extra layer of precision to this process by providing standardized terms and definitions for different types of events and entities within the supply chain. This ensures that everyone involved in the recall process is speaking the same language, which can help to reduce confusion and improve efficiency.

In addition to facilitating the identification and tracking of affected products, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can also help with other aspects of the recall process, such as determining the extent of the recall, notifying customers, and ensuring that all affected products are properly disposed of or repaired.

## Case Study: The Peanut Butter Recall of 2012

One example of how EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV have been successfully used to manage recalls is the Peanut Butter Recall of 2012. This recall involved a large quantity of peanut butter that was found to be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria.

Thanks to the use of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV, the affected products were quickly identified and tracked back to their source. This helped to minimize the number of products that needed to be recalled and reduced the risk of further harm to consumers.

Additionally, the CBV was used to provide clear and precise definitions of different types of events and entities within the supply chain, which helped to ensure that all parties involved in the recall process were speaking the same language and understood the scope and severity of the situation.

Overall, the use of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV in this recall helped to streamline and speed up the recall process, resulting in improved efficiency, reduced costs, and better protection for consumers.

## Conclusion

Recalls can be a challenging and complex process for any business, but the use of technology like EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can make a significant difference. By providing real-time visibility and clear, standardized definitions of different entities and events within the supply chain, these technologies can help to streamline the recall process, reduce costs, and improve the safety and satisfaction of consumers.
