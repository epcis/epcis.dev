# Overview of the Core Component in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

Modern supply chains are often complex and difficult to manage, especially when dealing with large numbers of products and multiple participants across different regions. To address these challenges, the GS1 (Global Standards One) organization has developed a set of standards designed to optimize supply chain visibility.

The GS1 EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) 2.0 standard, alongside the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), is a powerful tool for businesses seeking to achieve complete visibility into their supply chains.

This post discusses the core component in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, exploring how they work and why they are critical for any modern supply chain.

## Understanding GS1 EPCIS 2.0

GS1 EPCIS is a standard that provides a uniform way of describing supply chain events so they can be transmitted between different applications, organizations, and systems. It operates using electronic product codes (EPCs), which are unique identifiers that are attached to products and components in the supply chain.

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 builds on the original standard, offering more powerful tools for sharing and processing supply chain data. It is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, allowing businesses of all sizes and types to take advantage of the benefits of supply chain visibility.

## Introduction to the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) serves as the foundation for GS1 EPCIS 2.0, providing a standardized set of terms for describing supply chain events. The CBV is a comprehensive data model that defines the types of information that should be shared in supply chain events and how that information should be structured.

At its core, the CBV defines a common language that all participating organizations can use to describe supply chain events. This allows data to be exchanged more easily and accurately between different applications and systems.

Some of the key features of the CBV include:

- A shared data model that all participants can use to describe events
- Standards for defining and managing business documents, such as purchase orders and invoices
- A standardized set of terms for describing product attributes, such as weight and volume
- Definitions for key supply chain roles, such as supplier and customer

## Core Component in GS1 EPCIS 2.0

The core component in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is the Event Capture Interface (ECI). The ECI is an API (Application Programming Interface) that provides a way for businesses to capture, store, and share supply chain data.

The ECI serves as the bridge between the CBV and the supply chain applications and systems used by businesses. It takes data that is transmitted between these systems and translates it into a standard format that can be easily shared with other participants in the supply chain.

Using the ECI, businesses can capture a range of supply chain events, including:

- Product shipments
- Product location changes
- Product quality control checks
- Product inventory updates

All of these events can be captured by the ECI and transmitted to other participants in the supply chain in real-time, providing complete visibility into the status of products and components at any point in the supply chain.

## Deep Dive into the Core Component in GS1 EPCIS 2.0

To fully understand the benefits of the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, it is important to dive deeper into the core component, the ECI.

The ECI is designed to be highly flexible and scalable, allowing businesses to tailor it to their specific needs. It can be integrated with a range of different supply chain applications and systems, and can even be customized to work with proprietary systems that are unique to an organization.

One of the key advantages of the ECI is its ability to capture data in real-time. This means that events can be recorded and shared as they occur, providing businesses with immediate insight into their supply chain performance. For example, if a product is delayed at a shipment port, this delay can be recorded in the EPCIS 2.0 system and shared with other participants in real-time, allowing downstream businesses to adjust their plans accordingly.

Another advantage of the ECI is its ability to capture and share data automatically. Businesses can set up rules and triggers that automatically capture certain supply chain events and transmit them to other participants in the chain. This greatly reduces the risk of errors and delays caused by manual data entry and processing.

Finally, the ECI provides a powerful tool for analyzing supply chain data. Businesses can use the data captured by the ECI to identify trends and patterns in their supply chain performance, allowing them to make more informed decisions about inventory management, product sourcing, and other critical aspects of their business.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the core component in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is a powerful tool that provides businesses with complete visibility into their supply chains. The ECI serves as the bridge between different supply chain applications and systems, capturing and translating data into a standard format that can be easily shared with other participants.

By utilizing the ECI, businesses can capture a wide range of supply chain events in real-time, reducing the risk of delays and errors caused by manual data entry and processing. Furthermore, the ECI provides a powerful tool for analyzing supply chain data, allowing businesses to make more informed decisions about inventory management, product sourcing, and other critical aspects of their business.

Overall, the core component in GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provides businesses with the tools they need to optimize supply chain visibility and performance, allowing them to remain competitive in today's rapidly changing business landscape.
