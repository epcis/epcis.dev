# GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV: Potential Use Cases for Your Business

As the world becomes increasingly connected and information becomes more accessible, it's becoming more important than ever for businesses to track and manage their products and assets. One standard that's been gaining popularity in recent years is GS1's EPCIS 2.0, which provides a framework for tracking and sharing granular data about products and events throughout the supply chain. Combined with the recently released CBV (Core Business Vocabulary), EPCIS 2.0 can help businesses improve their inventory management, product traceability, and supply chain visibility. In this post, we'll explore what EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are, how they work together, and potential use cases for businesses of all sizes.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, and it's a standard developed by GS1, an international organization dedicated to developing and maintaining global supply chain standards. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of this standard, and it provides a framework for tracking and sharing information about products, events, and locations within the supply chain. 

With EPCIS 2.0, businesses can create and share "events" that describe what's happening to a product or asset, such as when it's received or shipped, where it's located, and what condition it's in. These events are organized in a hierarchy, with the top-level event representing the entire supply chain journey of a product and lower-level events providing more granular details. EPCIS 2.0 also includes support for a wide variety of data formats, including barcodes, RFID tags, and sensors, making it a flexible and adaptable standard for tracking and sharing supply chain data.

## What is CBV?

CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a new standard developed by GS1 that provides a common language for describing supply chain events and assets. CBV defines a set of standardized attributes that can be used to describe products, locations, and events, making it easier for different businesses and systems to communicate with each other. 

One of the key benefits of CBV is that it helps to eliminate the need for custom mappings between different systems. Previously, businesses that wanted to share information about products and events had to create custom translations between their own internal codes and those used by their partners or customers. With CBV, all parties can use the same standardized definitions, reducing errors and misinterpretations.

## How do EPCIS 2.0 and CBV work together?

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are complementary standards that work together to provide a comprehensive framework for tracking and sharing supply chain data. EPCIS 2.0 provides the structure for organizing and sharing events, while CBV provides the standardized definitions for the attributes used within those events. This allows businesses to create and share events that all parties can understand and interpret, regardless of their internal systems or processes.

For example, a manufacturer might use EPCIS 2.0 to share events about the production and shipment of their products, including the date and location of each event, as well as any relevant product attributes (such as batch number or expiration date). These events could be shared with their distributors and retailers using a standardized CBV vocabulary, ensuring that everyone has a clear and consistent understanding of the information being shared.

## Potential Use Cases for Businesses

So, how can businesses benefit from using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV? Here are five potential use cases:

### 1. Improving inventory management

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help businesses improve their inventory management by providing real-time visibility into the location and movement of their products. By using RFID tags or barcodes to track products throughout the supply chain, businesses can quickly and accurately identify where products are located, how many are in stock, and when they need to be restocked. This can help businesses reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking, improving their bottom line and customer satisfaction.

### 2. Enhancing product traceability

One of the primary benefits of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is their ability to provide granular traceability information about products. This is especially important in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, where product recalls can be costly and potentially life-threatening. By using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to track and share information about products, businesses can quickly and accurately trace the origin and journey of each product, making it easier to identify and address quality issues.

### 3. Streamlining supply chain operations

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help businesses streamline their supply chain operations by providing a common language for describing supply chain events. By using standardized definitions for attributes such as product type, location, and time, businesses can reduce the need for manual data entry and custom mappings between systems. This can lead to faster and more accurate data sharing, reducing errors and delays throughout the supply chain.

### 4. Supporting sustainability initiatives

Many businesses are increasingly focused on sustainability and reducing their environmental impact. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help support these initiatives by providing greater visibility into product movements and lifecycle. By tracking the origin and journey of products, businesses can identify areas where they can reduce waste or improve efficiency, such as optimizing shipping routes or reducing packaging materials.

### 5. Meeting regulatory requirements

Finally, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help businesses meet regulatory requirements by providing detailed information about product journeys and events. In industries such as pharmaceuticals and food, where regulations around product traceability and safety are strict, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can help businesses demonstrate compliance with these regulations. This can help businesses avoid costly fines or legal issues, while also building trust and loyalty with customers.

## Conclusion

As businesses become more connected and supply chain data becomes more important, standards like EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are becoming increasingly relevant. By providing a common language for describing products and supply chain events, these standards can help businesses improve inventory management, enhance product traceability, streamline operations, support sustainability initiatives, and comply with regulatory requirements. Whether you're a small business or a multinational corporation, there are many potential use cases for EPCIS 2.0 and CBV that can help you improve your bottom line and provide better service to your customers.
