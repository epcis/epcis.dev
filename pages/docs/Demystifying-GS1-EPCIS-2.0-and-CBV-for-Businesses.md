# Demystifying GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Businesses

In today's global market, retailers and manufacturers require standardized procedures, tools, and coding systems to facilitate supply chain transparency, product traceability, and inventory management, amongst other benefits. This is where GS1's Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) come into play. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are two standards that help businesses make sense of their supply chain by providing an infrastructure for tracking and managing their products, which leads to better decision-making, reduced costs and increased efficiency. This article aims to provide an introduction to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, their deep dive, and how they can benefit businesses.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standard for collecting and sharing information on the movement and status of products in the supply chain, from raw materials to end customers. EPCIS uses the Electronic Product Code (EPC), a globally unique identifier, to trace the movement of items within the supply chain. EPCIS 2.0 builds on the previous version, EPCIS 1.2, with enhancements that include better support for data exchange between systems and improved event model handling. EPCIS can store multiple events for a product throughout its lifecycle, providing a complete history of the productâ€™s journey in the supply chain.

### Benefits of EPCIS 2.0

The following are some of the benefits that EPCIS 2.0 offers for businesses:

1. Improved Product Traceability: EPCIS 2.0 provides visibility into the entire supply chain, from the origin of raw materials to the end customer, improving product traceability. This makes it easier for businesses to identify any issues related to the quality or safety of products and take corrective actions.

2. Improved Inventory Management: EPCIS 2.0 enables businesses to track their inventory levels in real-time, leading to improved inventory management. It also helps businesses identify which products are not selling and which products are out of stock.

3. Increased Efficiency: EPCIS 2.0 reduces the need for manual tracking of products, which leads to increased efficiency in the supply chain.

### How EPCIS 2.0 Works

The EPCIS 2.0 standard defines a set of events that can be used to track the movement and status of products. These events can be created by different systems and applications in the supply chain, such as warehouse management systems, transportation management systems, and point-of-sale systems. The events are stored in an EPCIS repository, which acts as a central hub for all data related to the products.

The following diagram illustrates the basic flow of EPCIS 2.0 events within the supply chain:

Each event in EPCIS 2.0 contains information on the product, such as its EPC, its current location, the time of the event, and other optional attributes. The EPCIS repository stores these events in a standardized format, making it easy for businesses to exchange data with their trading partners.

## What is GS1 CBV?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a set of globally recognized standard terms and definitions used to describe key concepts in business transactions, such as product identification and location identification. CBV builds on the existing GS1 Global Data Dictionary, which provides a standardized set of terms for data attributes used in GS1 standards such as barcode identifiers, electronic product codes, and RFID tags.

### Benefits of CBV

The following are some of the benefits that CBV offers for businesses:

1. Improved Data Quality: CBV improves the accuracy of data by providing standardized definitions for key business concepts, such as product identification and location identification.

2. Increased Efficiency: CBV enables quicker and easier data exchange, leading to increased efficiency in the supply chain.

3. Improved Interoperability: By providing standardized definitions, CBV improves interoperability between different data systems, making it easier for businesses to exchange data with their trading partners.

### How CBV Works

CBV consists of a set of globally recognized, standardized terms that are used to describe key concepts in business transactions, such as product identification and location identification. CBV terms are typically used in conjunction with GS1 identifiers (e.g., Global Trade Item Numbers) to provide additional context for business data.

The following diagram illustrates how CBV fits into the overall GS1 architecture:

CBV is designed to work alongside other GS1 standards, such as EPCIS 2.0, to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for supply chain management.

## Deep Dive into EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 is a complex system, and to truly understand it, we need to dive into its architecture and event models. EPCIS 2.0 is built on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), which enables it to work seamlessly with other systems in the supply chain. The EPCIS 2.0 architecture consists of four layers:

1. **Event Capture and Generation**: This layer includes systems and applications that generate EPCIS events. These events can include information on product location, movement, status, and other relevant data.

2. **Event Management**: This layer provides a service-centric view of EPCIS events, such as event validation, event storage, and event query. This layer provides the API that other systems can use to send and receive events.

3. **Event Repository**: This layer stores EPCIS events in a structured and standardized format, making it easy for businesses to exchange data with each other. The event repository can be a centralized or distributed system.

4. **Event Discovery and Retrieval**: This layer enables businesses to discover and retrieve EPCIS events from the repository. This layer also provides search capabilities, enabling businesses to query the repository for specific events.

The following diagram illustrates the EPCIS 2.0 architecture:

In addition to its architecture, EPCIS 2.0 defines a set of event models that provide a standardized way of capturing and describing events in the supply chain. The following are some of the event models defined in EPCIS 2.0:

1. **Object Event**: Object events capture information on the movement and status of a single item in the supply chain.

2. **Aggregation Event**: Aggregation events capture information on the movement and status of a group of related items in the supply chain.

3. **Transaction Event**: Transaction events capture information on a business transaction that occurred in the supply chain, such as a shipment or receipt of goods.

4. **Transformation Event**: Transformation events capture information on the transformation of a product in the supply chain, such as the repackaging of items.

5. **Association Event**: Association events capture information on the relationship between two or more items in the supply chain, such as a parent-child relationship.

## How Businesses Can Benefit from EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide businesses with a comprehensive suite of tools for supply chain management, from product traceability to inventory management. By implementing these standards, businesses can benefit in the following ways:

1. Improved Data Quality: EPCIS 2.0 and CBV provide standardized definitions for key business concepts, leading to improved data quality and accuracy.

2. Increased Efficiency: By providing a standardized infrastructure for supply chain management, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV enable quicker and easier data exchange, leading to increased efficiency in the supply chain.

3. Improved Product Traceability: EPCIS 2.0 provides visibility into the entire supply chain, from the origin of raw materials to the end customer, improving product traceability. This leads to faster identification of issues related to the quality or safety of products and quicker corrective actions.

4. Improved Inventory Management: EPCIS 2.0 enables businesses to track their inventory levels in real-time, leading to improved inventory management. It also helps businesses identify which products are not selling and which products are out of stock.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, GS1's Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) are vital standards for businesses in today's global market. They provide businesses with tools for supply chain management, enabling improved product traceability, inventory management, and increased efficiency.
