# EPCIS and Collaboration in Supply Chain Networks

The world of supply chain management is evolving at a rapid pace. In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, companies are increasingly turning to technologies like Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) to help them gain better visibility and control over their supply chains.

## What is EPCIS?

At its core, EPCIS is a standard that defines a set of interfaces for accessing information about items and their movements in supply chain networks. The standard was first introduced by the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) industry in 2007 and has since been adopted by a number of major organizations, including the International Standards Organization (ISO).

EPCIS is designed to help companies improve their supply chain management by providing them with real-time visibility into the movements of goods and materials. By using EPCIS, companies can see where their products are at any given time, which can help them make better decisions about how to manage their inventory, optimize their production processes, and respond more quickly to changing market conditions.

## The Benefits of EPCIS in Supply Chain Networks

One of the most important benefits of EPCIS is that it enables organizations to collaborate more effectively with their partners in the supply chain. By providing a standard interface for accessing information about products and their movements, EPCIS helps to break down the traditional silos that have often prevented effective collaboration between different stakeholders in the supply chain.

For example, when a manufacturer uses EPCIS to track its products, it can provide its suppliers and customers with real-time information about where the products are and when they will arrive. This can help suppliers better manage their inventory and production processes, while also enabling customers to plan their own operations more effectively.

Another key benefit of EPCIS is that it enables companies to improve their traceability and recall capabilities. By tracking products throughout the entire supply chain, companies can quickly identify where an issue has occurred and take action to address it. This can help to reduce the risk of costly recalls, while also helping to protect the safety and well-being of consumers.

## Collaboration in Supply Chain Networks

Of course, EPCIS alone is not enough to enable effective collaboration in supply chain networks. In order for collaboration to be successful, companies need to be willing to share information with their partners and work together to optimize their supply chain processes.

To achieve this, many companies are turning to collaborative platforms that enable them to share data and insights with their partners. These platforms provide a single, centralized location where partners can access real-time information about products and their movements, collaborate on planning and production processes, and coordinate their efforts to optimize their supply chains.

One example of a collaborative platform that is gaining popularity in supply chain networks is blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables multiple parties to share information in a secure and transparent manner. By using blockchain, companies can create a shared database of information that is accessible to all relevant parties, while also ensuring that the information is accurate and up-to-date.

## Conclusion

EPCIS is a powerful tool for enabling collaboration in supply chain networks. By providing a standard interface for accessing information about products and their movements, EPCIS helps to break down silos and enable more effective collaboration between different stakeholders in the supply chain.

However, collaboration is not simply a matter of technology. In order for collaboration to be successful, companies need to be willing to share information and work together to optimize their supply chain processes. By doing so, companies can improve their efficiency, reduce their costs, and ultimately deliver better products and services to their customers.
