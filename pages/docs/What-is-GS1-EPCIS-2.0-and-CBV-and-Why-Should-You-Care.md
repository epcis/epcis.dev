# What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV and Why Should You Care?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 (Electronic Product Code Information Services) and CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) may be unfamiliar terms to many people, but they play an important role in the world of supply chain management. These standards were developed by GS1, an international not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for the identification and communication of products, services, and locations.

In this blog post, we will explore what GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are, how they work, and why they are important for all businesses, especially those involved in the supply chain.

## What is GS1 EPCIS 2.0?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standard for the exchange of supply chain event information, based on the Electronic Product Code (EPC) technology. EPC technology uses unique identification numbers to track and trace products and their movement through the supply chain. By using a standardized language to describe supply chain events, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 allows different organizations to share information about product movements and status, regardless of the software or systems they use.

With GS1 EPCIS 2.0, businesses can track and monitor their supply chain in real-time, enabling better decision-making, improved inventory visibility, reduced stock-outs, and enhanced customer service. Additionally, the standard provides a common language for businesses to communicate across different countries and regions, making it easier to conduct business globally.

## What is CBV?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a critical component of GS1 EPCIS 2.0. CBV provides a common language for describing the events and transactions in the supply chain. By standardizing the terms used to describe common supply chain events, businesses can more easily communicate with one another, even across different languages, cultures, and systems.

The goal of CBV is to simplify the exchange of supply chain event information, and reduce the need for custom coding and translation when integrating different systems. This helps to reduce errors, improve efficiency, and improve communication among different parties.

## How does GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV work?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV work together to provide businesses with a standardized way to share supply chain information. The standard uses an EPC Repository to store information about products, locations, and events. The EPC Repository provides a centralized location for businesses to store and access supply chain event information, making it easier to track and monitor products as they move through the supply chain.

The EPC Repository uses standardized event types and object classes to describe supply chain events. These event types and object classes are defined by CBV, and provide a common language for describing supply chain events. For example, an event type might be "Shipment" while an object class might be "Product." By using standardized event types and object classes, businesses can easily understand and interpret supply chain data, regardless of the system or software used to generate it.

## Why is GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV important?

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are important for several reasons. First, they enable businesses to track and monitor their supply chain in real-time, enabling better decision-making, improved inventory visibility, reduced stock-outs, and enhanced customer service. Second, the standard provides a common language for businesses to communicate across different systems, making it easier to conduct business globally. Finally, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV help to reduce errors, improve efficiency, and improve communication among different parties, leading to cost savings and improved supply chain performance.

In addition to these benefits, compliance with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV is often a requirement for doing business with many large retailers and manufacturers. By using these standards, businesses can ensure that they are meeting the requirements of their customers, and remain competitive in a global marketplace.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are essential standards for businesses involved in the supply chain. They enable businesses to track and monitor their supply chains in real-time, making it easier to make informed decisions, improve inventory visibility, reduce stock-outs, and enhance customer service. Additionally, the standard provides a common language for businesses to communicate across different systems, making it easier to conduct global business. By complying with these standards, businesses can remain competitive and continue to grow in a rapidly changing global marketplace.
