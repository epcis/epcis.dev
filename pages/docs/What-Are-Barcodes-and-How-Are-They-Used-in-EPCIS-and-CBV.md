# What Are Barcodes & How Are They Used in EPCIS and CBV?

Barcodes have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, from scanning products at the grocery store to tracking packages as they are shipped to our doorstep. But what exactly are barcodes, and how are they used in the world of EPCIS and CBV?

## What Are Barcodes?

A barcode is a machine-readable representation of data, typically consisting of a series of parallel lines or dots of varying width and spacing. The data encoded in a barcode can contain information about the product, such as its name, price, and manufacturer, as well as other details such as a unique identification number.

There are several types of barcodes, each with its own specific format and use case. The most common barcode types include:

- **UPC**: The Universal Product Code (UPC) is perhaps the most well-known barcode type. It is used primarily in the retail industry to track products at the point of sale.

- **Code 39**: Code 39 is a popular barcode format that can encode both letters and numbers. It is commonly used in logistics and manufacturing to track inventory and goods as they move through the supply chain.

- **QR Code**: The Quick Response (QR) Code is a type of two-dimensional barcode that can store much more data than traditional barcodes. This makes it a popular choice for marketing and advertising, as QR codes can be used to promote products and services by providing customers with additional information.

## How Are Barcodes Used in EPCIS?

EPCIS, or Electronic Product Code Information Services, is an industry-standard protocol for sharing information about products and their movement through the supply chain. Barcodes are a key component of EPCIS, as they provide a way to uniquely identify products and track them as they move through different stages of the supply chain.

For example, let's say a manufacturer produces a batch of widgets that are destined for a retailer. Each widget could be assigned a unique barcode that contains information about the product, such as its name, quantity, and manufacturing date. As the widgets are shipped from the manufacturer to the retailer, their barcodes can be scanned at various points along the way, allowing the supply chain partners to track their movement and ensure that they arrive at the retailer on time.

But barcodes aren't just useful for tracking products as they move through the supply chain. They can also be used to capture data about how products are used and consumed once they reach the end consumer. For example, a retailer could use barcodes to track which products are selling well in different regions, and adjust their inventory levels accordingly.

## How Are Barcodes Used in CBV?

CBV, or Core Business Vocabulary, is a standard used in electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions to describe the data elements and structures used by trade partners. Barcodes play an important role in CBV, as they provide a way to identify and track products as they move through the supply chain.

One of the key benefits of using barcodes in CBV is that they provide a standardized way to identify products, regardless of which trade partner is using them. This helps to reduce errors and improve efficiency, as trade partners can be confident that they are working with the correct product information.

Barcodes can also be used in CBV to capture additional information about products, such as their weight, dimensions, and material composition. This helps to ensure that trade partners have a complete and accurate picture of the products they are working with, which can improve decision-making and reduce waste.

## Conclusion

Barcodes are a critical piece of technology in the world of EPCIS and CBV. By providing a standardized way to identify and track products, they help to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and minimize waste throughout the supply chain.

As we continue to see advancements in technology such as IoT sensors and RFID, it will be interesting to see how barcodes continue to evolve and adapt to meet the changing needs of the industry. But for now, barcodes remain an essential tool for anyone involved in the world of supply chain management and electronic data interchange.
