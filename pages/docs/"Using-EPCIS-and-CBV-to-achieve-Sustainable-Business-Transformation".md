# Using EPCIS and CBV to achieve Sustainable Business Transformation

Sustainability has become an increasingly important topic for businesses of all sizes. Not only is it important for a business to reduce its carbon footprint and promote environmental protection, but it also helps to increase efficiency and save money in the long run. With the help of advanced technology like the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), businesses can achieve sustainable business transformation.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard that is used to track and share data related to the movement of goods and products through the supply chain. This standard was developed by the not-for-profit organization EPCglobal, which is a subsidiary of GS1. EPCIS allows businesses to track the entire lifecycle of a product from the point of origin to the point of consumption. This includes information such as where the product was manufactured, what materials were used, and where it was sold.

EPCIS provides real-time visibility into product movement, which is essential for sustainable business transformation. With this information, businesses can identify inefficiencies in their supply chain and make changes to reduce waste and promote environmental protection.

## What is CBV?

CBV is a vocabulary that is used to standardize the description of business processes and information. CBV was also developed by EPCglobal and is meant to be used in combination with EPCIS. CBV simplifies the exchange of information between different systems and organizations. This helps to reduce errors and improve efficiency.

With CBV, businesses can clearly define their business processes and the information that is related to those processes. This allows businesses to identify areas where they can improve and make changes to promote sustainability.

## How can EPCIS and CBV be used for sustainable business transformation?

EPCIS and CBV can be used together to achieve sustainable business transformation in several ways. Here are some examples:

### Efficient supply chain management

EPCIS and CBV allow businesses to have greater visibility into their supply chain. This helps businesses to identify inefficiencies and reduce waste. By tracking product movement and understanding where there are delays or bottlenecks, businesses can make changes to their supply chain that promote sustainability.

For example, if a company is using too much packaging, EPCIS can help to identify where in the supply chain the extra packaging is being added. CBV can then be used to identify alternative packaging materials that may be more sustainable.

### Improved product lifecycle management

EPCIS provides real-time information about the entire lifecycle of a product, from the point of origin to the point of consumption. CBV can be used to standardize the information that is related to the product lifecycle. This allows businesses to identify areas where they can make changes to promote sustainability.

For example, if a company is using materials that are harmful to the environment, EPCIS and CBV can help to identify where those materials are being used in the product lifecycle. This allows the company to make changes to the materials that are being used.

### More efficient business processes

CBV can be used to standardize the description of business processes and information. This allows businesses to identify areas where they can improve and make changes to promote sustainability.

For example, if a company is using a lot of paper in its business processes, CBV can help to identify where paper is being used and whether there are alternative digital solutions that can be used instead.

### Better collaboration with suppliers and customers

EPCIS and CBV can be used to share information with suppliers and customers in a more efficient and standardized way. This helps to promote sustainability across the entire supply chain.

For example, if a company is working with a supplier that is using harmful materials in its products, EPCIS and CBV can be used to communicate this information to the supplier. Together, the two companies can work to identify alternative materials that are more sustainable.

## Conclusion

Sustainability is essential for the long-term success of any business. EPCIS and CBV provide advanced technology that can help businesses achieve sustainable business transformation. By providing real-time visibility into product movement and standardizing the description of business processes and information, businesses can identify inefficiencies in their supply chain, improve product lifecycle management, make their business processes more efficient, and collaborate more effectively with suppliers and customers. Ultimately, this promotes sustainability and helps businesses to save money while doing their part to protect the environment.
