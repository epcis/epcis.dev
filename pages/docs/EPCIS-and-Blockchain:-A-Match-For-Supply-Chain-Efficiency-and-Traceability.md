# EPCIS and Blockchain: A Match For Supply Chain Efficiency and Traceability

The world of supply chain management is rapidly evolving, with greater emphasis being placed on technologies that can help to streamline operations, drive efficiency, and improve the overall efficiency and traceability of the supply chain. One such technology that has gained significant attention in recent times is the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS). This technology is designed to provide a standardized framework that enables businesses to know 'who, what, when, where, why, and how' across the supply chain and business operations.

However, EPCIS technology alone may not be enough to ensure the efficiency and traceability of the supply chain. This is where blockchain technology comes in, providing an ideal match for EPCIS to achieve the desired results. In this blog post, we'll explore the relationship between EPCIS and blockchain, their individual and combined benefits and challenges, and how they can be leveraged to achieve supply chain efficiency and traceability.

## Understanding EPCIS

First, what exactly is EPCIS and why is it important? EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, and it is a set of global standards developed by GS1, a non-profit organization that creates and maintains global standards for the supply chain. The goal of EPCIS is to provide visibility and traceability in the supply chain by enabling businesses to share information about the movement and location of products and assets across the entire supply chain, from the point of origin to the final destination.

EPCIS does this by defining a standard way of capturing and sharing information about products, assets, and events across the supply chain. This includes information such as:

- Who: the parties involved in the movement of a product or asset (e.g., manufacturer, supplier, carrier)
- What: the product or asset being moved (e.g., serial number, batch number, lot number)
- When: the time and date of events such as shipping, receiving, and storage
- Where: the location of events such as shipping, receiving, and storage
- Why: the reason for the movement of a product or asset (e.g., purchase order, sales order, transfer order)
- How: the method of transport used to move the product or asset (e.g., truck, ship, air)

By capturing and sharing this information in a standardized way, EPCIS enables businesses to have complete visibility and traceability of products and assets across the entire supply chain. This, in turn, can help to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer service.

## Understanding Blockchain

Now, let's look at blockchain technology and its relevance to the supply chain. Blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions and stores them in a tamper-evident and secure way. The ledger is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any single entity, but instead consists of a network of computers that all participate in the validation and storage of transactions.

The key benefits of blockchain for the supply chain lie in its ability to provide a secure and transparent way of tracking and sharing information, without the need for a centralized authority or intermediary. This makes it ideal for industries where trust and transparency are vital, such as the food and pharmaceutical industries.

## The Benefits of Combining EPCIS and Blockchain

So, how can EPCIS and blockchain work together to provide greater efficiency and traceability in the supply chain? There are several key benefits to combining these two technologies:

### Enhanced Security and Data Integrity

One of the primary benefits of combining EPCIS and blockchain is enhanced security and data integrity. By leveraging the tamper-evident and decentralized nature of blockchain, businesses can ensure that the information captured and shared via EPCIS is secure and cannot be altered or tampered with.

This is especially important in industries such as the food and pharmaceutical industries, where the integrity of the supply chain is crucial. By using blockchain to store and secure the information captured by EPCIS, businesses can ensure that the products they are moving are authentic and have not been tampered with.

### Improved Traceability

Another benefit of combining EPCIS and blockchain is improved traceability. By capturing and sharing information about the movement and location of products and assets across the supply chain, EPCIS provides a high level of visibility into supply chain operations. By leveraging blockchain to store and secure this information, businesses can further enhance this visibility and traceability, enabling them to quickly identify and address issues such as product recalls or supply chain disruptions.

### Increased Efficiency

Finally, combining EPCIS and blockchain can help to increase supply chain efficiency. By providing a standardized way of capturing and sharing information across the supply chain, EPCIS can reduce the amount of time and effort required to manage and track shipments. By leveraging blockchain to secure and share this information, businesses can further streamline supply chain operations, reducing costs and improving overall performance.

## The Challenges of Combining EPCIS and Blockchain

While there are clear benefits to combining EPCIS and blockchain, there are also several challenges that must be addressed. One of the main challenges is the integration of these two technologies.

EPCIS was designed to work with a variety of systems and technologies, including RFID, barcodes, and sensors. However, blockchain is a relatively new technology and integrating it with existing systems and processes can be challenging. Businesses will need to ensure that their existing systems are compatible with blockchain, or invest in new systems that can support this technology.

Another challenge is the issue of governance. Blockchain is decentralized, meaning that there is no single entity that controls the network. This can make it difficult to establish governance and accountability for the information captured and shared via EPCIS. Businesses will need to work together to establish governance models that ensure the integrity and security of the information captured and shared via this technology.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS and blockchain are a natural match for achieving greater efficiency and traceability in the supply chain. By leveraging EPCIS to capture and share standardized information about products and assets, and blockchain to store and secure this information, businesses can enhance security, improve traceability, and increase efficiency.

However, achieving these benefits will require careful planning and execution. Businesses will need to overcome the challenges of integrating EPCIS and blockchain and establishing governance models that support these technologies. With the right approach, EPCIS and blockchain can help to transform the supply chain, driving greater efficiency and transparency across the entire ecosystem.
