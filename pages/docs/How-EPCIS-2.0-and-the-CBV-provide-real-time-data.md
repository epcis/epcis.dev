# How EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV Provide Real-Time Data

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 is a global standard that specifies the communication and sharing of event-based information. It provides real-time, end-to-end visibility across the supply chain and enables stakeholders to have a complete and accurate view of inventory, product movement, and quality.

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is one of the building blocks of the EPCIS 2.0 standard, which is used to represent business entities and their relationships in a supply chain environment. The use of CBV ensures that data is consistently represented, making it easier to interpret, understand, and use by different stakeholders.

This article outlines how EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provide real-time data, the benefits of using this technology, and how it can promote transformation for businesses.

## EPCIS 2.0 and Real-Time Data

EPCIS 2.0 is designed to provide real-time and end-to-end visibility of products, assets, and their movements. It enables stakeholders to access real-time data from various systems, including enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, logistics management systems, and warehouse management systems.

EPCIS 2.0 allows companies to track the real-time location and status of their products throughout the supply chain, which can inform critical business decisions such as when to restock inventory, when to ship products, and how to optimize the supply chain for more efficient operations.

With EPCIS 2.0, stakeholders can access data from multiple systems in real-time, allowing them to make data-driven decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information. For example, if a company receives information about a delay in shipment, it can quickly identify an alternative route and inform customers about the updated delivery time.

Furthermore, EPCIS 2.0 enables stakeholders to have complete visibility on product provenance, which is becoming increasingly important in the modern supply chain environment. With consumers increasingly concerned about issues such as sustainability, ethical sourcing, and fair labor practices, companies need to be able to provide full transparency about the origin of their products.

## CBV and Data Consistency

The CBV is a key component of EPCIS 2.0 that ensures data is consistently represented and easy to interpret, understand, and use by different stakeholders.

The CBV provides a standardized vocabulary for defining entities in the supply chain, such as products, locations, and events. This standardization ensures that everyone in the supply chain is using the same definitions, and it reduces the risk of misinterpretation and errors.

For example, a company may refer to a product as "green tea," while another company may call it "organic tea." Without a standardized vocabulary such as CBV, systems may interpret those terms differently, leading to confusion and errors. By using CBV, stakeholders can ensure that they are referring to the same entity, regardless of the terminology used.

Furthermore, the CBV provides valuable information that can be used to understand the relationships between entities in the supply chain. For example, the CBV can indicate which products are sourced from a particular location or which products are dependent on certain ingredients.

## Benefits of Using EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

The use of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provides several benefits to businesses, including:

### Real-time visibility

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV enable businesses to track products in real-time, providing full visibility of the inventory, product movements, and status. This real-time visibility allows businesses to respond quickly to any issues, make data-driven decisions, and optimize their supply chain operations.

### Improved accuracy

The use of CBV ensures that everyone in the supply chain is referring to the same entities with consistent definitions, reducing the risk of misinterpretation and errors. This improved accuracy can result in cost savings, reduced waste, and better customer satisfaction.

### Increased efficiency

By using standardized vocabulary in the CBV, businesses can streamline their supply chain operations and reduce the time and effort needed to interpret data. With the ability to access real-time supply chain data, businesses can optimize their operations to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

### Enhanced collaboration

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV enable stakeholders to collaborate more effectively by providing a common language and platform for sharing data. This collaboration can lead to better decision-making, improved relationships, and a more efficient supply chain.

## Transformation through EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV

The use of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can promote transformation for businesses of all sizes. By providing real-time data, businesses can become more agile and responsive to change, enabling them to meet customer needs more effectively.

Furthermore, the use of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV promotes transparency and accountability, which can improve customer trust and loyalty. Businesses can use this technology to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability, ethical sourcing, and other social responsibility initiatives.

The adoption of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can also lead to improved supply chain collaboration and innovation. By providing a common language and platform for sharing data, businesses can work together to identify opportunities for process improvement, reduce waste, and create more efficient supply chains.

Finally, the use of EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can promote the adoption of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. By providing a standardized language for data sharing, EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV can facilitate the integration of these technologies into the supply chain, enabling businesses to realize the full potential of digital transformation.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and the CBV provide businesses with real-time data, consistency, accuracy, and efficiency, enabling transformation in the way they operate. By improving supply chain visibility and collaboration, businesses can become more agile, responsive, and sustainable, meeting the needs of customers and stakeholders for years to come.
