# The Power of EPCIS and CBV in Business Process Automation

In today's world, the need for making business processes more efficient and automated has become an essential requirement. The use of technology in businesses has increased exponentially, and automating businesses processes can help companies save both time and money by increasing the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of their operations.

One of the most essential technologies for automating businesses processes is the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV). The combination of these two technologies can help businesses transform the way they operate, making processes more streamlined, effective, and efficient.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard that was developed by EPCglobal, and it enables businesses to track and manage physical objects such as products, assets, and equipment using the Electronic Product Code (EPC). EPC is a unique identification number that is used to identify a product or an item in a supply chain.

EPCIS helps businesses share information about the movement and location of physical objects across the entire supply chain. It provides real-time visibility into the status and location of objects, which helps businesses make informed decisions about their operations.

## What is CBV?

CBV is a vocabulary that is used to describe the data that is captured and shared using EPCIS. It provides a standard format for defining data elements and their relationships to each other.

The use of CBV ensures that data is consistent and interoperable across different systems and applications. It also allows businesses to capture and share data in a standardized way, which helps them streamline and automate their processes.

## How EPCIS and CBV work together

EPCIS and CBV work together to automate businesses processes by providing a way to capture and share data in a standardized format.

When an object is moved or changes location, the EPC is scanned and the information is captured using EPCIS. This information is then mapped to the relevant CBV elements, which ensures that the data is consistent and interoperable.

This data can then be shared across different systems and applications, which enables businesses to track the movement and location of objects across the entire supply chain.

The use of EPCIS and CBV also enables businesses to automate their processes by setting up rules and workflows based on the data that is captured. For example, when an object is moved from one location to another, a workflow can be triggered to update the inventory management system and order new supplies.

## Benefits of using EPCIS and CBV in Business Process Automation

The use of EPCIS and CBV in business process automation provides several benefits to businesses, including:

### 1. Real-time visibility and tracking

EPCIS and CBV provide real-time visibility and tracking of physical objects across the entire supply chain. This enables businesses to make informed decisions about their operations based on the current status and location of objects.

### 2. Increased accuracy and efficiency

The use of EPCIS and CBV ensures that data is captured and shared in a standardized way, which increases the accuracy and efficiency of business processes. This helps businesses save time and money by reducing errors, duplications, and manual interventions.

### 3. Improved supply chain management

By providing real-time visibility and tracking of objects, EPCIS and CBV can help businesses improve their supply chain management. This enables businesses to optimize their inventory levels, reduce lead times, and improve their overall supply chain performance.

### 4. Better decision-making

The use of EPCIS and CBV enables businesses to capture and analyze data in real-time, which helps them make better and more informed decisions. This can help businesses identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement in their operations.

### 5. Scalability

EPCIS and CBV are scalable technologies that can be used by businesses of any size. They can be integrated with existing systems and applications, which makes them a cost-effective solution for businesses looking to automate their processes.

## Case study: Walmart

One of the most notable examples of the power of EPCIS and CBV is Walmart. In 2010, Walmart announced that it was going to implement a new system that would require all of its suppliers to use EPCIS and CBV.

The new system, known as the Electronic Product Code Information System (EPCIS), enabled Walmart to track and manage the movement and location of products across its entire supply chain. This increased the accuracy and efficiency of its operations, which helped the company save millions of dollars in inventory costs.

The implementation of EPCIS and CBV also helped Walmart improve its supply chain management. This enabled the company to reduce lead times, optimize its inventory levels, and improve its overall supply chain performance.

## Conclusion

The use of EPCIS and CBV in business process automation is an essential requirement for businesses looking to optimize their operations and increase their efficiency. These technologies provide real-time visibility and tracking of physical objects, which enables businesses to make informed decisions about their operations.

The use of EPCIS and CBV also increases the accuracy and efficiency of business processes, improves supply chain management, and helps businesses make better and more informed decisions. The scalability of these technologies also makes them a cost-effective solution for businesses of any size.

Businesses that implement EPCIS and CBV can expect to see significant benefits to their operations, which can help them stay competitive and succeed in today's fast-paced business environment.
