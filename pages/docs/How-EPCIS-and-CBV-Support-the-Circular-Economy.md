# How EPCIS and CBV Support the Circular Economy

In recent years, the concept of the circular economy has gained significant attention from environmentalists, policymakers, and businesses alike. The circular economy is a system in which resources are used and reused, reducing waste and minimizing the negative impact on the environment. It relies on a shift from the traditional "take-make-waste" model to a more sustainable approach that prioritizes resource efficiency, product longevity, and the recovery and reuse of materials.

As companies strive to transition to a circular economy, technology solutions are playing an increasingly vital role in enabling them to achieve these goals. This is where EPCIS and CBV come in - two technologies that can help businesses track products and materials throughout their lifecycle, ensuring that they are used to their fullest potential and minimizing waste.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS, or Electronic Product Code Information Services, is a standard developed by GS1, the global organization devoted to the development and implementation of supply chain standards. EPCIS provides a standardized framework for tracking and exchanging information about the movement of goods across the supply chain.

Through the use of EPCIS, businesses can track products and materials as they move through the supply chain - from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption. EPCIS allows businesses to capture a wide range of data, including the location of products, product attributes, and any events that occur during the product's lifecycle (such as when it is shipped, received, or sold).

By providing this level of visibility and granularity, EPCIS enables businesses to make more informed decisions about the use and reuse of resources. For example, a manufacturer might use EPCIS data to identify areas of waste in the production process or to optimize the use of raw materials.

## What is CBV?

CBV, or Circular Business View, is a framework developed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that provides a holistic view of a business's materials and products throughout their lifecycle. CBV is designed to help businesses move away from the traditional linear model of production and consumption towards a more circular approach.

CBV allows businesses to track and trace the flow of materials and products through the supply chain, from raw materials to product disposal or recycling. It provides a view of the entire lifecycle of a product, including its use, maintenance, repair, and eventual disposal or recycling.

By using CBV, businesses can identify opportunities for resource efficiency, product longevity, and the recovery and reuse of materials. For example, a manufacturer might use CBV data to identify areas where a product can be redesigned to prolong its lifespan or to identify opportunities for material recovery and reuse.

## How do EPCIS and CBV work together?

EPCIS and CBV are complementary technologies that work together to provide a comprehensive view of a product's lifecycle. EPCIS provides the granular data that allows businesses to track and trace products through the supply chain, while CBV provides a holistic view of the entire lifecycle, from raw materials to product disposal or recycling.

Together, EPCIS and CBV enable businesses to make more informed decisions about the use and reuse of resources. By capturing detailed data on the movement of goods through the supply chain, EPCIS allows businesses to identify areas of inefficiency and waste. CBV builds on this by providing a broader view of the entire lifecycle, enabling businesses to identify opportunities for resource efficiency, product longevity, and the recovery and reuse of materials.

For example, a business might use EPCIS to monitor the movement of a product through the supply chain, from raw materials to finished product. This data might reveal inefficiencies in the production process that result in waste. The business can then use CBV to identify opportunities to redesign the product or production process to minimize waste and ensure that materials are used to their fullest potential.

## Case Study: H&M and the Circular Business View

One example of a business using EPCIS and CBV to support the circular economy is H&M. The clothing retailer has adopted CBV as a framework for tracking the materials and products used in its supply chain, from raw materials to finished products and beyond.

Through the use of CBV, H&M is able to identify opportunities for resource efficiency, product longevity, and material recovery and reuse. For example, H&M has implemented a garment collection program, which allows customers to bring in unwanted clothing items for recycling. The company then uses CBV to track the flow of these materials through the supply chain, from recycling to the creation of new products - ensuring that materials are used to their fullest potential.

H&M is also using EPCIS to improve supply chain visibility and reduce waste. The company is using EPCIS data to track the movement of garments through the supply chain, from production to distribution to the point of sale. This data allows H&M to optimize its supply chain, reduce waste, and ensure that materials are used to their fullest potential.

## Conclusion

As businesses strive to transition to a more circular economy, technology solutions like EPCIS and CBV are playing an increasingly vital role. These technologies enable businesses to track products and materials throughout their lifecycle, ensuring that they are used to their fullest potential and minimizing waste.

By working together, EPCIS and CBV provide a comprehensive view of a product's lifecycle - from raw materials to disposal or recycling. This enables businesses to identify opportunities for resource efficiency, product longevity, and the recovery and reuse of materials. As more businesses adopt these technologies, we can look forward to a future in which the circular economy becomes the norm, rather than the exception.
