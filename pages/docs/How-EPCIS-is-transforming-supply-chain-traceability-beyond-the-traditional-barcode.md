# How EPCIS is transforming supply chain traceability beyond the traditional barcode

In today's fast-paced and digital world, supply chain traceability is more important than ever. The ability to track products and shipments through the entire supply chain from manufacturer to end customer is critical in ensuring product safety and quality, reducing waste, and increasing efficiency. Traditionally, this has been done using barcodes and other manual processes, but with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other technologies, Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is transforming supply chain traceability in ways that were once unimaginable.

## What is EPCIS?

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard that enables the sharing of supply chain data among trading partners in real-time. EPCIS was created by GS1, a non-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for supply chain management. EPCIS uses unique identifiers, such as RFID tags and barcodes, to track products and shipments through the supply chain.

EPCIS offers several benefits over traditional supply chain traceability methods. Firstly, EPCIS provides real-time visibility into the supply chain, allowing manufacturers, suppliers, and customers to track products in real-time from anywhere in the world. This level of visibility allows for more efficient decision-making, as companies can quickly identify and respond to supply chain disruptions or product quality issues.

Secondly, EPCIS enables end-to-end traceability, meaning that companies can track products from raw materials all the way through to the end customer. This level of traceability is critical in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, where product safety is a top priority.

Finally, EPCIS enables data sharing between trading partners, meaning that companies can share supply chain data with each other in real-time. This level of data sharing enables more efficient collaboration between trading partners, leading to increased efficiency and reduced waste.

## Beyond the Traditional Barcode

While barcodes have been the traditional means of tracking products and shipments through the supply chain, EPCIS is taking traceability beyond the barcode in several key ways.

### RFID Technology

One of the ways in which EPCIS is transforming supply chain traceability is through the use of RFID technology. RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification and is a wireless technology used to track and identify objects. RFID technology uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.

RFID tags can store significantly more data than traditional barcodes and can be read at much greater distances. This level of data storage and distance enables real-time tracking of products and shipments, even in large-scale supply chains. RFID technology also allows for tracking of products and shipments through hard-to-reach areas, such as cargo holds and storage containers.

The use of RFID technology is particularly beneficial in industries with complex supply chains, such as the automotive and aerospace industries. In these industries, products are often made up of thousands of parts and components, making tracking and tracing them through traditional means a challenging task. RFID technology enables real-time tracking of all components and parts, ensuring that the final product meets safety and quality standards.

### IoT and Blockchain

Another way in which EPCIS is transforming supply chain traceability is through the use of IoT and blockchain technology. IoT refers to the network of physical devices connected to the internet, such as sensors and cameras. These devices can provide real-time data about products and shipments, enabling more efficient tracking and monitoring of supply chain operations.

Blockchain technology, on the other hand, is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner. Blockchain technology can be used to verify the authenticity and provenance of products, reducing the risk of counterfeit products and fraud. This level of transparency and security is critical in industries such as pharmaceuticals and luxury goods.

The use of IoT and blockchain technology in conjunction with EPCIS enables real-time tracking of products and shipments, along with secure and transparent data sharing between trading partners. This level of data sharing and transparency enables more efficient supply chain operations and reduces the risk of product fraud and counterfeiting.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS is transforming supply chain traceability beyond the traditional barcode in several key ways. The use of RFID technology, IoT, and blockchain technology enables real-time tracking of products and shipments, along with secure and transparent data sharing between trading partners. This level of visibility and efficiency enables more efficient decision-making and reduced waste, while also ensuring product safety and quality.

As the supply chain continues to evolve and become more complex, EPCIS will continue to play a critical role in ensuring that products are tracked and traced in a way that is efficient, transparent, and secure.
