# An Introduction to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Business Owners

If you’re a business owner looking to establish trust with your customers or improve your internal supply chain processes, GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are two protocols worth exploring. Both help businesses track products and share information about them with supply chain partners, making it easier to manage inventory and respond to customer inquiries. In this post, we’ll provide an overview of GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, explain how they work, and discuss some of the benefits they offer.

## What is GS1?

GS1 is a non-profit organization that provides unique identifiers for products, services, and locations around the world. Their system of standards helps businesses exchange information with each other and with customers in a consistent, universal format. With a GS1 identifier, a product can be identified anywhere in the world, making it easier to track and trace products throughout the supply chain. GS1 provides a range of services to support businesses, including training, certification, and software solutions.

## What is EPCIS?

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard created by GS1 that enables businesses to share information about products and their movements throughout the supply chain. EPCIS helps businesses track products from the point of manufacture to the point of sale, providing visibility into the supply chain that can help with inventory management and quality control. EPCIS is based on a set of data exchange protocols that enable businesses to share information in a consistent, structured format.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the EPCIS standard, released in 2015. It supports new features and data structures that weren’t available in the previous version, including support for blockchain-based data sharing and event-based data sharing. EPCIS 2.0 also provides better support for data harmonization and data quality, making it easier for businesses to share accurate information with their supply chain partners.

## What is CBV?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a standard created by GS1 that provides a standardized vocabulary for describing products and their attributes. CBV enables businesses to share information about their products in a consistent, structured format, making it easier to compare products across different suppliers and platforms. CBV is built on top of existing GS1 standards, such as GTIN and GLN, and provides a common language that businesses can use to communicate with each other and with customers.

## How do EPCIS and CBV work together?

EPCIS and CBV are designed to work together to provide end-to-end visibility into the supply chain. CBV provides a standardized vocabulary for describing products and their attributes, while EPCIS provides a set of data exchange protocols that enable businesses to share this information with each other. By combining CBV and EPCIS, businesses can create a shared understanding of the products they’re exchanging, making it easier to manage supply chain processes and respond to customer inquiries.

## What are the benefits of using EPCIS and CBV?

There are several benefits to using EPCIS and CBV, including:

### Improved supply chain visibility

By using EPCIS and CBV, businesses can gain visibility into their supply chain that they may not have had before. This visibility can help with inventory management, quality control, and compliance monitoring, making it easier to respond to supply chain issues and improve overall performance.

### Reduced data errors

EPCIS and CBV both provide structured data exchange protocols that help to reduce errors related to manual data entry or data exchange. By using these protocols, businesses can ensure that they’re sharing accurate information with their supply chain partners, reducing the risk of errors and miscommunications.

### Improved customer trust

By providing more information about their products and supply chain processes, businesses can build trust with their customers. This can help to improve customer loyalty and repeat purchases, as customers will have more confidence in the products they’re buying and the companies they’re buying from.

### Competitive advantage

By adopting EPCIS and CBV, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and demonstrate their commitment to transparency and accountability. This can help to distinguish them from competitors and attract customers who value these qualities.

## Conclusion

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are two powerful tools that can help businesses improve supply chain visibility, reduce errors, build customer trust, and gain a competitive advantage. By adopting these standards, businesses can establish a shared understanding of their products and supply chain processes, making it easier to manage inventory, respond to customer inquiries, and improve overall performance. If you’re a business owner looking to improve your supply chain processes or build trust with your customers, consider exploring GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to see if they’re right for you.
