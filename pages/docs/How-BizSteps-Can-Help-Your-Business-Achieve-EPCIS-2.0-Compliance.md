# How BizSteps Can Help Your Business Achieve EPCIS 2.0 Compliance

If you are a business operating in the manufacturing, retail, or supply chain industry, you may have heard of the EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) 2.0 standard. EPCIS 2.0 is a globally recognized standard that allows businesses to track and trace products throughout the supply chain in a standardized and efficient manner. Compliance with this standard can lead to numerous benefits, including improved visibility, enhanced security, and increased efficiency. In this blog post, we will discuss how BizSteps can help your business achieve EPCIS 2.0 compliance and reap the benefits.

These events allow you to track and trace products throughout the supply chain, from the manufacturer to the end user.

## Why is EPCIS 2.0 Compliance Important?

EPCIS 2.0 compliance is important for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it allows businesses to track and trace products throughout the supply chain in a standardized and efficient manner. This can help improve visibility, enhance security, and increase efficiency.

Improved visibility is a major benefit of EPCIS 2.0 compliance. With this standard, businesses can track products in real-time as they move through the supply chain. They can see exactly where a product is, who has it, and when it will be delivered. This level of visibility can help businesses make better decisions, improve customer service, and reduce waste.

Enhanced security is another benefit of EPCIS 2.0 compliance. By tracking and tracing products throughout the supply chain, businesses can ensure that products are not lost or stolen. They can also ensure that products are not tampered with or counterfeited. This can help improve product safety and protect the brand reputation.

Finally, EPCIS 2.0 compliance can increase efficiency. With this standard, businesses can automate processes and reduce the amount of manual labor required to track and trace products. This can help reduce costs, improve accuracy, and increase speed.
