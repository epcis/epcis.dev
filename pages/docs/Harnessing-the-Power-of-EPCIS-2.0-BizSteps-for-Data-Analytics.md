# Harnessing the Power of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps for Data Analytics

In recent years, businesses have seen a tremendous explosion in data growth. The need for handling data in a more structured and organized manner has increased drastically. EPCIS provides a standard for exchanging data between trading partners. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the EPCIS standard, which has introduced some new elements such as BizSteps, which are a powerful tool for data analytics.

## What are BizSteps?

BizSteps are a new feature in the EPCIS 2.0 standard. A BizStep is defined as a specific step in a business process. They can be used to track and trace a product or service as it moves through the different stages of the supply chain. BizSteps provide a way to capture information about an entire business process, such as receiving, shipping, packaging, and manufacturing, to name a few.

## How Do You Use BizSteps?

To utilize BizSteps effectively, the first step is to identify your business processes. Once you have identified your processes, it would be best to define your BizSteps. To define your BizSteps, you can start by listing out every step involved in your processes. The next step would be to group similar steps, and then assign a unique identifier to each group of steps. These unique identifiers will become the BizSteps in your EPCIS 2.0 implementation.

Once you have defined your BizSteps, you can use them to track and trace products or services as they move through the supply chain. You can capture relevant data for each BizStep, such as location, time, and quantity, to name a few. This data can be used for analytical purposes, such as identifying bottlenecks in the supply chain or identifying trends in customer behavior.

## Using BizSteps for Data Analytics

BizSteps can be used for data analytics in several ways. Here are a few examples:

### Identifying Supply Chain Bottlenecks

By capturing data at each BizStep, you can identify bottlenecks in the supply chain. For example, if you notice that there is a delay in the receiving process, you can drill down to find out where the bottleneck is. This information can be used to optimize your supply chain and improve efficiencies.

### Predictive Analytics

By analyzing data trends across your BizSteps, you can identify patterns that may indicate future demand. This information can be used to optimize your inventory levels and ensure that you always have the correct amount of inventory on hand.

### Real-time Visibility

By capturing data in real-time, you can gain visibility into your supply chain as it happens. This information can be used to make real-time decisions, such as rerouting shipments, changing production schedules, or updating inventory levels.

## Using BizSteps for Compliance and Track and Trace

In addition to using BizSteps for data analytics, they can also be used for compliance and track and trace purposes. Here are a few examples:

### Compliance

BizSteps can help companies comply with regulations related to product safety, such as the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). By capturing data for each BizStep, you can ensure compliance with these regulations and avoid costly fines.

### Track and Trace

BizSteps can be used for track and trace purposes to ensure the safety and integrity of products. By capturing data for each BizStep, you can track products as they move through the supply chain and trace them back to their source in case of a recall or safety issue.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, BizSteps are a powerful tool for data analytics and compliance in the supply chain. By capturing data for each BizStep, companies can gain real-time visibility into their supply chain, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their processes. Additionally, BizSteps can help companies comply with regulations related to product safety and track and trace requirements.

With the explosive growth of data in recent years, the need for structured and organized data has increased drastically. BizSteps provide a standardized way to capture data at each step of the supply chain, making it easier for companies to analyze and utilize that data for their business. As the supply chain continues to evolve, the use of BizSteps will become more prevalent, and companies that can harness their power will have a significant advantage over their competitors.
