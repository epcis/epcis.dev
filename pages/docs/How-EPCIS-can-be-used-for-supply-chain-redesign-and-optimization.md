# How EPCIS can be used for supply chain redesign and optimization

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard developed by GS1, an international nonprofit organization that develops and maintains global standards for business communication. The primary goal of EPCIS is to enable electronic sharing of supply chain event data in a standardized way. This sharing of event data can help companies improve their supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. In this blog post, we will explore how EPCIS can be used for supply chain redesign and optimization.

## Understanding the EPCIS Standard

Before we dive into how EPCIS can be used for supply chain redesign and optimization, it is important to understand the EPCIS standard. EPCIS defines a standardized way to represent and share information about supply chain events. An event can be anything from the receipt of materials to the shipment of finished goods. The standard defines a set of data elements that describe an event, including the time and location of the event, the identities of the parties involved, and the product information associated with the event.

The EPCIS standard is based on a flexible data model that allows companies to capture and share information about their supply chain events in a way that is meaningful to them. This flexibility enables companies to use the standard in a wide variety of supply chain contexts.

## Redesigning the Supply Chain with EPCIS

One of the ways in which EPCIS can be used for supply chain redesign is by enabling companies to reimagine their existing supply chain processes. By capturing and sharing detailed information about supply chain events, companies can gain a deeper understanding of their supply chain performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

For example, a company may use EPCIS to track the movement of products through their supply chain. By analyzing this data, the company may discover that certain products are frequently delayed or held up at specific points in the supply chain. Armed with this information, the company can work to identify and address the root causes of these delays, such as inefficiencies in the transportation process or issues with the supplier.

Similarly, EPCIS can be used to identify opportunities to streamline supply chain processes. By analyzing supply chain event data, companies may discover that they can reduce transportation costs by optimizing their shipping routes, or that they can improve inventory management by adjusting their reorder points.

## Optimizing the Supply Chain with EPCIS

In addition to enabling supply chain redesign, EPCIS can also be used to optimize existing supply chain processes. By sharing supply chain event data in real-time, companies can gain greater visibility into their supply chain performance and respond quickly to changes and disruptions.

For example, imagine a company that uses EPCIS to track the movement of goods through their supply chain. If a shipment is delayed or held up, the company can quickly identify the root cause of the delay and take action to address it. This might involve contacting the supplier to expedite the shipment, or diverting the shipment to a different transportation route.

EPCIS can also be used to optimize inventory management. By sharing real-time information about inventory levels and demand, companies can adjust their stocking levels and reorder points in response to changing customer needs.

## EPCIS and End-to-End Visibility

One of the key benefits of EPCIS is that it enables end-to-end visibility into the supply chain. By capturing and sharing data about supply chain events, companies can gain a holistic view of their supply chain performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

End-to-end visibility is particularly important in today's global supply chains, where products may be sourced from multiple suppliers and transported across multiple countries. EPCIS enables companies to track products from the initial supplier to the end customer, providing a complete view of the supply chain.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, EPCIS is a powerful tool for supply chain redesign and optimization. By capturing and sharing detailed data about supply chain events, companies can gain a deeper understanding of their supply chain performance and identify opportunities for improvement. EPCIS also enables real-time visibility into the supply chain, enabling companies to quickly respond to changes and disruptions. Ultimately, the adoption of EPCIS can lead to improved supply chain efficiency, reduced costs, and better customer satisfaction.
