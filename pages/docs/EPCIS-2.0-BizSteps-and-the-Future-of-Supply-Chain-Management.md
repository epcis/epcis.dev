# EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps and the Future of Supply Chain Management

The complexity of modern supply chains is ever-increasing, with multiple parties and systems involved in the end-to-end process. The ability to track and share information about goods, from their point of origin to the point of sale, is crucial to ensuring that companies can operate efficiently and effectively. This is where EPCIS 2.0 comes in.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a standard for describing the movement and status of products as they move through the supply chain. It provides a shared language for all parties involved in the supply chain, allowing them to share information about inventory levels, delivery times, and other metrics.

EPCIS 2.0 is an updated version of the EPCIS standard that adds support for new data types and improves interoperability between different systems. It includes standard definitions for events and object types that can be used to describe the movement of goods, such as when a product is received, when it is shipped, and when it is sold.

## What are BizSteps?

BizSteps are a set of standardized business processes that allow companies to use EPCIS 2.0 to describe their supply chain activities. They provide a common language for different parties to describe their operations and give companies a shared understanding of how their business processes work.

BizSteps cover a wide range of supply chain activities, including receiving goods, managing inventory, picking and shipping orders, and handling returns. Each BizStep is defined using standard EPCIS 2.0 events and object types, allowing companies to share information about their processes in a consistent and standardized way.

## The Benefits of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

The use of EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps can bring significant benefits to companies involved in supply chain management. Here are just a few examples:

### Improved Visibility

EPCIS 2.0 provides a shared language for describing supply chain events, allowing parties to monitor and track goods as they move through the supply chain. This can help companies to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in their operations, allowing them to make adjustments and improve their processes.

### Increased Efficiency

By sharing information about supply chain events in a standardized way, companies can reduce the need for manual data entry and processing. This can lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs, as well as reducing the likelihood of errors or inconsistencies in data.

### Better Collaboration

Sharing information about supply chain events can help to build trust and collaboration between different parties involved in the supply chain. By providing a common language for sharing information, EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps can help to break down silos and improve communication between companies.

## The Future of Supply Chain Management with EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps

As the use of EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps becomes more widespread, we can expect to see significant changes in the way that supply chain management is conducted. Here are just a few potential benefits:

### Improved Traceability

By tracking goods using EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps, companies can monitor the movement of products throughout the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished products. This can help to ensure that goods are produced ethically and sustainably, as well as providing evidence of compliance with regulations and standards.

### Increased Resilience

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of global supply chains to disruption. By using EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps to share information about supply chain events, companies can build more resilient supply chains that are better able to respond to unexpected events.

### Enhanced Customer Experience

By providing greater visibility into supply chain operations, EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps can help companies improve the customer experience. Customers can be provided with more accurate information about delivery times and product availability, reducing the likelihood of order cancellations or dissatisfaction.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps provide a standardized language for describing supply chain events and processes. By using this language, companies can improve visibility, efficiency, and collaboration in their supply chain operations. As the use of EPCIS 2.0 and BizSteps becomes more widespread, we can expect to see significant changes in the way that supply chain management is conducted, including improved traceability, increased resilience, and enhanced customer experience.
