# Breaking Down the BizSteps of EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0, the latest version of Electronic Product Code Information Services, brings a lot of exciting new features to the table. Among them, perhaps the most important are the business steps, or BizSteps, that help to define the life cycle of any EPC-related object.

The BizSteps are critical to understanding and implementing EPCIS 2.0, so it's important to have a clear understanding of what they are and how they work. In this article, we'll break down the BizSteps and explain what they mean for your business.

## What are BizSteps?

In EPCIS 2.0, a BizStep is any distinct point in the life cycle of an EPC-related object where a business activity occurs. These activities could be anything from receiving an item in a warehouse to shipping it out to a customer, and everything in between.

By breaking down the life cycle of an EPC-related object into these distinct steps, businesses can more easily track and manage their supply chain operations. Each BizStep comes with a set of data attributes that help to define the activity that took place, such as who performed it, when it happened, and where it occurred.

## The BizStep Lifecycle

To understand how BizSteps work, it's helpful to look at the lifecycle of an EPC-related object. This lifecycle typically begins with the creation of an object, such as a product or package, and ends when that object is no longer in use, either because it's been consumed or disposed of.

In between these points, there are several distinct BizSteps, each with its own unique set of data attributes. These steps are:

### Transformation

The Transformation step occurs when an object is modified in some way, such as by being repackaged or reassembled. The data attributes associated with Transformation typically include the date and time of the change, as well as information about who made the change and why.

### Encoding

The Encoding step occurs when an EPC or other unique identifier is associated with the object. This is typically done through the use of RFID or other tracking technologies. The data attributes associated with Encoding typically include the date and time of encoding, as well as information about who performed the encoding and where it occurred.

### Receiving

The Receiving step occurs when an object is received at a location, such as a warehouse or retail store. The data attributes associated with Receiving typically include the date and time of receipt, as well as information about who received the object and where it was received.

### Shipping

The Shipping step occurs when an object is shipped from a location, such as a warehouse or retail store. The data attributes associated with Shipping typically include the date and time of shipment, as well as information about who shipped the object and where it was shipped.

### Aggregation

The Aggregation step occurs when multiple objects are combined into a single unit, such as when multiple packages are grouped together to create a pallet. The data attributes associated with Aggregation typically include the date and time of the aggregation, as well as information about who performed the aggregation and where it occurred.

### Disaggregation

The Disaggregation step occurs when a single unit is broken down into multiple objects, such as when a pallet is broken down into individual packages. The data attributes associated with Disaggregation typically include the date and time of the disaggregation, as well as information about who performed the disaggregation and where it occurred.

### Association

The Association step occurs when two or more EPC-related objects are associated with each other, such as when a product is associated with its packaging. The data attributes associated with Association typically include the date and time of the association, as well as information about the nature of the association and why it was made.

### Observation

The Observation step occurs when an event or activity related to an EPC-related object is observed or recorded, such as the temperature of a package being recorded during transport. The data attributes associated with Observation typically include the date and time of the observation, as well as information about the nature of the observation and who made it.

### Ownership

The Ownership step occurs when ownership of an EPC-related object changes hands, such as when a package is sold to a customer. The data attributes associated with Ownership typically include the date and time of the ownership transfer, as well as information about who the new owner is and why the transfer took place.

## Why Are BizSteps Important?

By breaking down the life cycle of an EPC-related object into these distinct steps, businesses can more easily track and manage their supply chain operations. This allows them to quickly and accurately identify any problems that arise and take corrective action as necessary.

For example, if a package is observed to have been damaged during shipping, the data attributes associated with the Observation step can help businesses identify exactly when and where the damage occurred, as well as who was responsible for it. This allows them to take corrective action, such as filing a claim with the shipping company or using the data to improve their packaging and shipping processes.

In addition to helping with problem identification and resolution, BizSteps can also be used to optimize supply chain operations. By tracking the time and cost of each step in the life cycle of an EPC-related object, businesses can identify areas where they can streamline their processes and reduce their costs.

## Implementing BizSteps in Your Business

Implementing BizSteps in your business requires a combination of hardware and software. You'll need RFID or other tracking technologies to associate EPCs with objects, as well as software to record and manage the data attributes associated with each BizStep.

The good news is that there are many vendors that offer EPCIS 2.0-compliant solutions to help businesses implement BizSteps in their supply chain operations. These solutions typically include both hardware and software components, and can be customized to meet the specific needs of any business.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 and its BizSteps are a powerful tool for managing supply chain operations. By breaking down the life cycle of an EPC-related object into distinct steps, businesses can more easily track and manage their operations, quickly identify and resolve any problems that arise, and optimize their processes to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

Implementing BizSteps in your business requires a combination of hardware and software, but with the help of an EPCIS 2.0-compliant vendor, it can be done quickly and easily. If you're looking to improve your supply chain operations, consider implementing EPCIS 2.0 and its BizSteps today.
