## EPCIS and CBV - Deep Dive

Before diving into the various ways of implementing EPCIS and CBV let's understand what they are.

### EPCIS

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard that provides a framework to capture and share supply chain event data. EPCIS enables enterprises to track products and share data in real-time with supply chain partners. It finds its application across industries such as retail, pharmaceuticals, food, and beverage.

### CBV

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a standard that provides a common language for businesses to communicate information about their products and services across supply chains. CBV comprises a set of predefined terms and definitions that enable information exchange across different systems and platforms.

## Five Ways to Implement EPCIS and CBV in Your Business

Here are five ways that you can implement EPCIS and CBV in your business:

### 1. Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility

EPCIS and CBV enable enhanced supply chain visibility by providing real-time tracking and tracing of products. Using these standards, businesses can track products through different stages of the supply chain and share data with their supply chain partners. This enhanced visibility leads to reduced operational costs, efficient inventory management, and better decision-making.
