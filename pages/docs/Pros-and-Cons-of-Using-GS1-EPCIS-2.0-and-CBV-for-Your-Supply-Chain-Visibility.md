# Pros and Cons of Using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for Your Supply Chain Visibility 

Supply chain visibility is a critical component of modern-day businesses. With the increasing complexity of supply chains across different geographies, it has become essential to monitor the flow of products and their associated data. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are two frameworks that businesses can use to gain supply chain visibility. In this article, we will dive deep into these frameworks and discuss their pros and cons.

## Introduction to GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is a standard developed by the Global Standard One (GS1) organization. The purpose of EPCIS is to provide a standardized way of sharing event data in the supply chain. By leveraging EPCIS, businesses can track products from their origin to their destination, monitor their status, and share information with stakeholders in the supply chain. 

CBV, on the other hand, is a protocol developed by the International Association of the Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA). CBV aims to provide a decentralized and secure way of sharing event data in the supply chain. By using CBV, businesses can ensure that their data is tamper-proof, transparent, and accessible to authorized parties.

## Pros of Using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

### GS1 EPCIS 2.0 Pros

1. Standardized Data Format: GS1 EPCIS 2.0 provides a standardized way of sharing event data in the supply chain. This means that businesses can easily share their data with multiple stakeholders, regardless of their location or the systems they use. By using a common language, businesses can avoid confusion and decrease the likelihood of errors in their supply chain.

2. Improved Traceability: By tracking products' movement and status using EPCIS, businesses can improve traceability within their supply chains. This means that businesses can easily locate where products are in their journey, monitor their condition, and ensure that they are meeting any necessary regulatory requirements.

3. Increased Efficiency: EPCIS enables businesses to track products in real-time, reducing the need for manual processes and increasing efficiency. By automating their supply chain, businesses can save time and resources, leading to cost savings and improved operational performance.

4. Better Customer Service: By leveraging EPCIS, businesses can provide better customer service by providing their customers with accurate and up-to-date information about their products' status. Customers can have greater confidence in their purchases and trust in the business.

### CBV Pros

1. Decentralized: CBV is decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority controlling the data. This ensures that no single entity can manipulate or censor data, providing greater transparency and trust in the supply chain.

2. Tamper-proof: CBV is built on blockchain technology, which ensures that data cannot be tampered with or altered. This means that businesses can have confidence that their data is accurate and reliable.

3. Secure: By using CBV, businesses can ensure that their data is secure and only accessible to authorized parties. This can help prevent data breaches and cyber-attacks, which can cause significant damage to a business's reputation.

## Cons of Using GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

### GS1 EPCIS 2.0 Cons

1. Dependence on Standards: EPCIS relies on industry standards and efforts by various parties to ensure it is implemented correctly. This means that businesses may not be able to use EPCIS if their partners or the systems they use do not adhere to the standards.

2. Complex Implementation: Implementing EPCIS can be complex and require significant resources to set up and maintain. Businesses need to invest in the necessary technology, expertise, and support to ensure they can use EPCIS effectively.

3. Ensuring Data Accuracy: While EPCIS provides a standardized way of sharing data, businesses must ensure that the data they input is accurate. Inaccurate data can lead to confusion, lost resources, and poor decision-making.

### CBV Cons

1. Limited Adoption: CBV is a relatively new technology, meaning that its adoption is limited. Businesses may struggle to find partners willing to use CBV or may face implementation challenges due to a lack of expertise or resources.

2. Performance: CBV's decentralized nature can lead to slower performance compared to centralized systems. Businesses must consider the cost and performance trade-offs when deciding to use CBV.

3. Integration: Businesses may need to integrate CBV with existing systems, which can be complex and require significant resources. This can add additional costs and delay implementation.

## Conclusion

GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV are two frameworks that businesses can use to gain supply chain visibility. EPCIS provides a standardized way of sharing data, improving traceability, increasing efficiency, and providing better customer service. CBV provides a decentralized, tamper-proof, and secure way of sharing data, ensuring transparency and trust in the supply chain.

Each framework has its pros and cons. Businesses need to consider their specific needs, as well as the resources, expertise, and partners available to make an informed decision. Ultimately, the goal is to select the solution that provides the best value for the business and improves supply chain performance, transparency, and trust.
