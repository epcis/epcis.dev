# GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV: Standards and Implementation Best Practices

The GS1 Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard is a globally adopted specification that enables supply chain visibility and traceability. EPCIS allows companies to share critical information about product movements, such as when and where a product was manufactured, shipped, received or sold, in a standardized and interoperable format. This standard has been widely used in industries such as retail, healthcare, and logistics to improve business processes, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.

Recently, GS1 has released an updated version of the EPCIS standard, the EPCIS 2.0, which introduces some major enhancements and extensions to the original version. One of the key additions to EPCIS 2.0 is the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), which defines a common set of terminology and codes that can be used to describe supply chain events and business processes. This blog post will provide an overview of the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards, as well as implementation best practices for companies looking to adopt these standards.

# Overview of GS1 EPCIS 2.0

The GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard is designed to address some of the limitations and use cases that were not fully covered by the original EPCIS standard. EPCIS 2.0 introduces several key changes to the data model, communication protocol, and event schema. Some of the most significant improvements include:

## Data model improvements

EPCIS 2.0 extends the original EPCIS data model to include additional object types, such as person, location, and transport object. These object types allow companies to capture more granular and detailed information about supply chain events and processes, such as the identity of the person who authorized a shipment or the name of the carrier who transported a product. In addition, EPCIS 2.0 supports the use of external identifier schemes, which enables the integration of EPCIS data with other systems and standards.

## Communication protocol enhancements

EPCIS 2.0 introduces a new communication protocol called HTTP/REST, which provides a simpler and more lightweight mechanism for exchanging EPCIS data between trading partners. The HTTP/REST protocol is easier to implement and supports real-time communication, which is particularly useful for applications that require a faster response time, such as track and trace or inventory management systems.

## Event schema extensions

EPCIS 2.0 extends the original EPCIS event schema to include new event types, such as transformation events, which describe changes to the form or composition of a product, and association events, which link two or more EPCs together. These event types enable companies to model more complex supply chain processes, such as manufacturing, assembly, or bundling, and to track the relationships between multiple products or items.

# Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a key component of the EPCIS 2.0 standard, as it provides a common framework for describing supply chain events and business processes. The CBV consists of a set of standardized codes and terminology that can be used to represent different aspects of a supply chain event, such as the type, time, location, and quantity of a product movement. The CBV is designed to be extensible and adaptable to different industry sectors and use cases.

The CBV comprises several domains, each of which covers a specific aspect of supply chain operations. Some of the core domains include:

## Event Type

The Event Type domain defines the basic types of supply chain events, such as Shipping, Receiving, Transformation, and Association. Each event type is assigned a unique code and description, which allows trading partners to understand the nature and purpose of a particular event.

## Business Location

The Business Location domain defines the different types of physical locations that are relevant to supply chain operations, such as Warehouse, Retail Store, Distribution Center, and Manufacturing Plant. Each location type is assigned a unique code and description, which enables trading partners to identify the origin, destination, and intermediate stops of product movements.

## Measurement

The Measurement domain defines the standard units of measurement for different types of products and quantities, such as weight, volume, and length. Each unit of measurement is assigned a unique code and description, which ensures consistency and accuracy in supply chain reporting.

## Product

The Product domain defines the different types of products that are relevant to supply chain operations, such as Finished Goods, Raw Materials, and Components. Each product type is assigned a unique code and description, which enables trading partners to identify the nature and characteristics of a product.

# Implementation Best Practices

Adopting the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards can provide significant benefits for companies looking to improve supply chain visibility and efficiency. However, implementing these standards requires careful planning and coordination, as well as attention to technical and business considerations. Here are some best practices to consider when implementing GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV:

## Define clear business requirements

Before embarking on an EPCIS 2.0 implementation, it is important to define clear business requirements and use cases that will guide the design and development of the solution. This involves identifying the specific supply chain processes and events that need to be captured and tracked, as well as the data elements and standards that will be used.

## Map existing data sources and systems

To ensure smooth integration with existing systems and data sources, it is important to map the data fields and formats used by those systems to the EPCIS 2.0 standard. This involves identifying the relevant data elements and mapping them to the appropriate CBV codes and terminology.

## Identify data quality and governance requirements

To ensure data accuracy and consistency, it is important to establish data quality and governance policies and procedures. This involves defining data validation rules, data ownership and stewardship responsibilities, and data access controls.

## Choose the most appropriate communication protocol

To enable effective communication with trading partners, it is important to choose the most appropriate communication protocol based on the specific use case and technical requirements. This involves evaluating the pros and cons of different protocols, such as HTTP/REST, MQTT, and SOAP, and selecting the one that meets the specific needs of the application.

## Test and validate the implementation

To ensure that the implementation meets the intended business requirements and technical standards, it is important to conduct thorough testing and validation before deploying the solution. This involves testing different scenarios and edge cases, as well as validating the compliance with the EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards.

# Conclusion

The GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards provide a powerful framework for enabling supply chain visibility, traceability, and efficiency. These standards are widely adopted and supported by companies and industries around the world, and offer significant benefits for organizations looking to optimize their supply chain operations. However, implementing these standards requires careful planning, coordination, and attention to technical and business considerations. By following the best practices outlined in this blog post, companies can ensure a successful and effective implementation of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV.
