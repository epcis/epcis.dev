# Understanding the EPCIS and CBV Standards

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions are more complex than ever before. They involve a broad range of technologies, including barcodes, Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and more. To ensure seamless communication between supply chain partners, these technologies must adhere to robust standards. In this blog post, we discuss two such standards - the EPCIS and CBV.

## What is EPCIS?

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a GS1 standard that defines a consistent way of communicating supply chain events between trading partners. EPCIS provides a standardized vocabulary to describe the movement of goods as they move through the supply chain.

EPCIS events are organized into a hierarchy of events that describe the actions and locations of products. At the top of the hierarchy is the Object Event, which tracks the movement of a specific product. This event includes information such as the time of the event, the location of the event, and the product’s identification code.

Object Events are organized into Aggregation Events, which describe the packaging hierarchy of products. For example, an Aggregation Event may describe a pallet that contains multiple boxes, where each box contains multiple products.

EPCIS also provides Query and Subscription Services, which allow supply chain partners to query EPCIS data and subscribe to updates as they occur. These services make it easier to track products as they move through the supply chain.

## What is CBV?

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is another GS1 standard that defines a set of common data elements for exchanging data between trading partners. CBV provides a standardized way of communicating product information, such as product descriptions, dimensions, and weights.

CBV uses a standardized vocabulary to describe products. This vocabulary includes terms such as GTIN, which is a globally unique product identification number, and Global Location Numbers (GLN), which are used to identify physical locations such as warehouses and retail stores.

## How do EPCIS and CBV work together?

EPCIS and CBV work together to provide a complete solution for tracking products through the supply chain. EPCIS provides a standardized way of communicating supply chain events, while CBV provides a standardized way of communicating product information.

When these two standards are used together, supply chain partners can track products as they move through the supply chain while maintaining a consistent view of the product data. This helps to reduce errors and improve supply chain efficiency.

For example, imagine a consumer goods company that wants to track the movement of a product from their factory to a retail store. The company would use the EPCIS standard to track the movement of the product through their supply chain, from the factory to the warehouse to the distribution center to the retail store.

At the same time, the company would use the CBV standard to communicate product information, such as the product’s GTIN and dimensions, to their supply chain partners. This information would be used to ensure that the product was properly labeled and packaged throughout the supply chain.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the EPCIS and CBV standards are critical components of modern supply chain communication. These standards provide a consistent way of communicating supply chain events and product information between trading partners. By using these standards, supply chain partners can reduce errors, improve efficiency, and ensure that products are properly tracked as they move through the supply chain.

If you’re interested in learning more about EPCIS and CBV, there are many resources available online. The GS1 website provides detailed information about these standards, including implementation guides and best practices. Additionally, many vendors offer software solutions that support EPCIS and CBV, making it easier to implement these standards in your supply chain.

In conclusion, a robust and efficient supply chain requires the use of modern technologies and standards such as EPCIS and CBV. So, ensure your supply chain partners adhere to these standards to make the most out of your products’ movement through the supply chain.
