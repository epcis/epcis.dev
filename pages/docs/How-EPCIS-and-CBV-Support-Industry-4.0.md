# How EPCIS and CBV Support Industry 4.0

The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is upon us, and it is transforming the way we live and work. From advanced robotics to the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0 is bringing together technology, data, and automation to create a more intelligent, efficient, and connected world.

One of the key components of Industry 4.0 is the ability to track and trace products and materials throughout the supply chain. This is where EPCIS and CBV come in. In this blog post, we'll take a deep dive into what EPCIS and CBV are, how they work, and how they support Industry 4.0.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS, or Electronic Product Code Information Services, is a global standard for tracking and tracing products and materials throughout the supply chain. It provides a standardized way to capture and share information about the movement and location of products and materials, as well as their condition, quality, and other attributes.

EPCIS uses a unique identifier called an Electronic Product Code (EPC) to identify individual products and materials. Each EPC contains a unique serial number, which allows products and materials to be tracked and traced throughout the supply chain, from the manufacturer to the retailer, and even to the end consumer.

## What is CBV?

CBV, or Core Business Vocabulary, is a standardized vocabulary for describing data and messages exchanged between trading partners in the supply chain. It provides a common language for different systems and applications to communicate with each other, making it easier to exchange data and automate business processes.

CBV includes a set of standardized codes and definitions for different types of data and messages, such as purchase orders, invoices, and shipment notifications. Using CBV, trading partners can ensure that they are using the same terminology and format for exchanging data, which helps to reduce errors and improve efficiency.

## How do EPCIS and CBV work?

EPCIS and CBV work together to provide a complete solution for tracking and tracing products and materials throughout the supply chain. Here's how it works:

1. A manufacturer assigns a unique EPC to each product or material, which is stored in a database.
2. The manufacturer creates an electronic document, such as a purchase order or shipment notification, using CBV codes and definitions.
3. The manufacturer sends the electronic document to their trading partner, such as a distributor or retailer.
4. The trading partner receives the electronic document and updates their own systems with the information.
5. The trading partner generates an EPCIS event, which captures information about the movement and location of the product or material, as well as any changes in its condition or quality.
6. The EPCIS event is sent to the manufacturer, who updates their database with the new information.
7. The EPCIS event is also sent to any other trading partners who need to know about the product or material, such as transportation companies or regulatory agencies.

By using EPCIS and CBV, trading partners can track and trace products and materials throughout the supply chain, from the manufacturer to the end consumer. This provides greater visibility into the supply chain, which helps to reduce waste, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## How do EPCIS and CBV support Industry 4.0?

EPCIS and CBV are critical components of Industry 4.0, as they enable the tracking and tracing of products and materials throughout the supply chain. Here are some of the benefits of using EPCIS and CBV in Industry 4.0:

### Improved visibility and traceability

EPCIS and CBV provide greater visibility into the supply chain, allowing trading partners to track and trace products and materials from the manufacturer to the end consumer. This improves traceability, which is critical in industries such as healthcare, where the quality and safety of products are paramount.

### Reduced waste and improved efficiency

By tracking and tracing products and materials throughout the supply chain, trading partners can identify inefficiencies and reduce waste. For example, they can identify bottlenecks in the supply chain and adjust production schedules to improve efficiency.

### Enhanced customer satisfaction

EPCIS and CBV enable trading partners to provide real-time information about the location, condition, and quality of products and materials to their customers. This enhances customer satisfaction, as customers can be assured that they are receiving high-quality products that meet their needs.

### Improved regulatory compliance

EPCIS and CBV help trading partners to comply with regulatory requirements, such as those related to product safety and quality. By providing accurate and timely information about the movement and location of products and materials, trading partners can ensure that they are meeting regulatory requirements and avoid penalties for non-compliance.

## Conclusion

EPCIS and CBV are critical components of Industry 4.0, as they enable the tracking and tracing of products and materials throughout the supply chain. By using EPCIS and CBV, trading partners can improve visibility, reduce waste, enhance customer satisfaction, and comply with regulatory requirements. As Industry 4.0 continues to evolve, EPCIS and CBV will play an increasingly important role in helping businesses to remain competitive and successful in an increasingly complex and connected world.
