# Navigating GS1 CBV Attributes

The GS1 CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a central part of the global language of business. It provides a framework for identifying and describing the essential elements of business transactions. The GS1 CBV includes a set of attributes, which are used to provide information about specific aspects of a product or service.

Navigating the GS1 CBV attributes can be challenging for individuals who are new to the GS1 system. However, with some guidance and an understanding of the basics, anyone can become proficient in navigating the GS1 CBV attributes.

## What are GS1 CBV Attributes?

GS1 CBV attributes are unique codes that provide information about specific aspects of a product or service. They are a standardized way of describing different types of information, such as product identifiers, pricing, and packaging details.

Each attribute consists of a four-character code and a set of rules that define how the information is organized and presented. Attributes can be used to describe physical or non-physical aspects of a product, such as weight, dimensions, or product images.

## Understanding the Structure of GS1 CBV Attributes

GS1 CBV attributes are structured according to a specific format, which consists of four key elements: the attribute identifier, the data element separator, the data value, and the attribute qualifier.

### Attribute Identifier

The attribute identifier is a four-character code that identifies the specific attribute. For example, the code for the weight attribute is “WEIG.” The identifier is used to ensure that the information is correctly interpreted and processed.

### Data Element Separator

The data element separator is a special character, usually a vertical bar (|), that separates the different parts of the attribute. It is used to help computers and other systems recognize the different parts of the attribute and process them correctly.

### Data Value

The data value is the actual information that is being conveyed by the attribute. For example, in the weight attribute (WEIG), the data value might be “1.5 KG” or “3.3 LBS.” This information is essential for accurate tracking and accounting of products.

### Attribute Qualifier

The attribute qualifier provides additional information about the data value. It is optional and may not be used for all attributes. For example, in the weight attribute, the attribute qualifier might be “NET” to indicate that the weight is the net weight of the product, excluding any packaging.

## Navigating GS1 CBV Attributes: Examples

To help understand how to navigate GS1 CBV attributes, let’s look at a few examples.

### 1. Product Identification Number (PID)

The Product Identification Number (PID) is a unique identifier that is used to identify a specific product. The PID attribute consists of four parts:

- Attribute Identifier: PIDG
- Data Element Separator: |
- Data Value: 123456789
- Attribute Qualifier: None

In this example, the PIDG attribute is being used to convey the product identification number of “123456789.” Note that the attribute qualifier is not used in this case.

### 2. Net Weight (WEIG)

The Net Weight (WEIG) attribute is used to convey the weight of a product. The attribute consists of four parts:

- Attribute Identifier: WEIG
- Data Element Separator: |
- Data Value: 1.5 KG
- Attribute Qualifier: NET

In this example, the WEIG attribute is being used to convey the net weight of the product, which is “1.5 KG.”

### 3. Pricing Information (PRI)

The Pricing Information (PRI) attribute is used to convey information about the pricing of a product. The attribute consists of four parts:

- Attribute Identifier: PRI
- Data Element Separator: |
- Data Value: 2.99
- Attribute Qualifier: PE

In this example, the PRI attribute is being used to indicate the unit price of the product, which is “2.99” per “each” or “PE”.

## Conclusion

Navigating GS1 CBV attributes is an essential skill for anyone who is involved in the global business community. Understanding the structure of the attributes and the different types of information they convey is critical to ensuring efficient and accurate business transactions.

By following the guidelines and examples provided above, individuals can become proficient in navigating GS1 CBV attributes and become an essential part of the global language of business.
