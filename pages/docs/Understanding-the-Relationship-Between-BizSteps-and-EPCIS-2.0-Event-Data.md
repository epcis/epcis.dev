# Understanding the Relationship Between BizSteps and EPCIS 2.0 Event Data

As industries and supply chain processes continue to evolve, the need for structured and standardized data becomes increasingly more important. The EPCIS 2.0 standard has emerged as a solution to help organizations manage product movement and traceability. In the world of EPCIS 2.0, there are two primary components that play a critical role in capturing and managing event data – BizSteps and Events.

Both BizSteps and Events are important elements of EPCIS 2.0 data models that supply chain professionals must understand. In this blog post, we’ll explore the key characteristics of BizSteps and their relationship with EPCIS 2.0 event data.

## What are BizSteps?

BizSteps are a series of steps that define a particular business process that a product goes through as it moves through the supply chain. These can include anything from manufacturing to shipping and receiving to marketing and sales. Understanding these steps is important for analyzing supply chain processes, tracking products, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

In EPCIS 2.0, BizSteps are represented as a business process hierarchy. This hierarchy not only provides a structured view of the supply chain processes but also helps to identify the relationship between them. These business processes can be standardized across different sectors and enable seamless communication between trading partners.

Furthermore, BizSteps can provide a standard vocabulary for supply chain stakeholders to describe the various steps of their business processes. This standardized vocabulary can help to eliminate confusion or miscommunication between partners, leading to greater efficiency and accuracy.

## What is EPCIS 2.0 Event Data?

EPCIS 2.0 event data is a key component of the EPCIS 2.0 standard. These events are records of a significant change in the status of a product, such as its location or condition. An example of an EPCIS 2.0 event might be a product being received into a warehouse or being shipped out to a customer.

In EPCIS 2.0, events are represented as a series of attributes that describe the specific event. These attributes can include information about the time, location, and participants involved in the event. The goal of EPCIS 2.0 event data is to provide a standardized and harmonized way to capture and share information about product movements across the supply chain.

## Understanding the Relationship Between BizSteps and EPCIS 2.0 Event Data

While BizSteps and EPCIS 2.0 event data might seem like separate concepts, they are in fact closely related. The relationship between the two can be best understood through the concept of “eventing on business steps.”

What this means is that EPCIS 2.0 event data is captured on specific business steps or changes within a business process. These events help to create a detailed record of the movements and changes that a product experiences as it moves through the supply chain. By knowing the specific business processes that a product undergoes, it becomes easier to capture, track, and analyze relevant event data.

For example, let’s say a product undergoes a manufacturing process that includes several steps such as production, packaging, and QA testing. Under the EPCIS 2.0 standard, each of these steps can be defined as a separate business process within the manufacturing workflow. When an event occurs within one of these steps, it is captured as a record within the relevant business process. This creates a detailed record of the product’s manufacturing process, its status at each step, and any relevant data associated with each step.

By capturing event data at various business steps, organizations can gain greater visibility into their supply chain processes. This data can be used to track product movement, improve efficiency, and identify areas for optimization or improvement. It can also be used to ensure compliance with regulations, such as those related to food safety or pharma traceability.

## Benefits of Using BizSteps with EPCIS 2.0 Event Data

By using BizSteps in conjunction with EPCIS 2.0 event data, organizations can derive several benefits. These benefits include but are not limited to:

- Greater visibility into supply chain processes: By using standardized business processes and event data, organizations can gain a more detailed view of their supply chain and identify areas for improvement and optimization.

- Improved efficiency: By using standardized vocabulary and data models, supply chain stakeholders can communicate more effectively, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy.

- Enhanced traceability: By capturing event data at various business steps, organizations can more easily trace the movements and changes of products as they move through the supply chain. This can improve product recall processes and ensure compliance with regulations.

## Conclusion

In the world of EPCIS 2.0, BizSteps and event data are two key components that enable organizations to manage product movement and traceability. By understanding the relationship between these two concepts, supply chain professionals can gain a greater understanding of their supply chain processes and derive significant benefits from the use of standardized data models.

While the adoption and implementation of EPCIS 2.0 might seem daunting, it is important to remember that the standard has been developed to provide a unified way to capture, store, and share supply chain data. By using BizSteps and event data in conjunction with EPCIS 2.0, organizations can ensure that they are leveraging standardized data models to improve their processes, drive greater efficiency, and enhance their traceability capabilities.
