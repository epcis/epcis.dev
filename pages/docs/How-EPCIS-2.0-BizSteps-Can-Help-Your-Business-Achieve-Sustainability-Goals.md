# How EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps Can Help Your Business Achieve Sustainability Goals

As businesses around the world strive to become more sustainable, it's essential to ensure that the technologies they use are compatible with this goal. One such technology is EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps, a framework developed by GS1, a global standards organization, to enable effective and efficient tracking and traceability of products across the supply chain.

In this blog post, we'll explore how EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can help your business achieve sustainability goals.

## What is EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps?

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps is a framework that enables the sharing of data about products as they move through the supply chain. It uses a standardized language to describe the movement of products, which helps to improve interoperability between different systems.

The framework was developed by GS1, a global standards organization that develops and promotes standards for the identification, tracking, and sharing of information about products, services, and locations.

EPCIS stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, and it is a global standard that provides a common language for describing the movement of products across the supply chain. BizSteps, on the other hand, is a set of best practices for the implementation of EPCIS in different industries.

Together, these two frameworks enable businesses to share information about products as they move through the supply chain. This helps to improve supply chain visibility, reduce waste, and enable more sustainable practices.

## How EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps Can Help Your Business Achieve Sustainability Goals

Sustainability is an increasingly important consideration for businesses around the world. As consumers become more aware of the impact of their purchases on the environment and society, businesses are under increasing pressure to become more sustainable.

Here are some ways that EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can help your business achieve sustainability goals.

### Improved Supply Chain Visibility

One of the key benefits of EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps is improved supply chain visibility. By sharing information about products as they move through the supply chain, businesses can gain a better understanding of where their products come from and how they are produced.

This can help businesses identify areas where they can become more sustainable. For example, if a business discovers that a supplier is using unsustainable practices, they can work with that supplier to improve their processes or find an alternative supplier that is more sustainable.

### Reduced Waste

Reducing waste is another essential aspect of sustainability. By tracking products as they move through the supply chain, businesses can identify areas where waste is being created and take steps to reduce it.

For example, if a business discovers that products are being damaged during transport, they can identify the cause of the damage and take steps to address it. This could involve improving packaging or working with transport companies to reduce the risk of damage during transport.

### Sustainable Sourcing

Sustainable sourcing is another important aspect of sustainability. By working with suppliers who use sustainable practices, businesses can help to reduce their environmental impact and support sustainable practices in the wider community.

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can help businesses identify suppliers who use sustainable practices by providing information about the origin of products and the processes used to produce them. This can help businesses make more informed decisions about where to source their products from.

### Environmental Impact Assessments

Environmental impact assessments are an essential part of sustainability. By assessing the environmental impact of their operations, businesses can identify areas where they can reduce their impact on the environment and take steps to become more sustainable.

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps can help businesses collect data about their operations, including the resources they use and the waste they produce. This data can be used to perform environmental impact assessments and identify areas where the business can become more sustainable.

## Conclusion

EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps is a powerful framework that can help businesses achieve sustainability goals. By improving supply chain visibility, reducing waste, supporting sustainable sourcing, and enabling environmental impact assessments, businesses can become more sustainable and reduce their impact on the environment and society.

As the world becomes more aware of the importance of sustainability, businesses that embrace technologies like EPCIS 2.0 BizSteps will be better positioned to meet the changing expectations of consumers and society. Adopting this framework can help businesses become more sustainable, reduce waste, and support sustainable practices in the wider community.
