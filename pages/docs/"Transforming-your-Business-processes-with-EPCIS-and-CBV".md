# Transforming your Business Processes with EPCIS and CBV

Efficient and effective communication within and outside an organization is essential, and with the advancement of technology, there exist tools that help in achieving communication and transparency. Today, two crucial components of effective communication in businesses are EPCIS and CBV. EPCIS, which stands for Electronic Product Code Information Services, is a standard for sharing and communicating supply chain events and for enhancing visibility into the supply chain. CBV, meanwhile, stands for Core Business Vocabulary, which is a set of standardized terms and definitions that are used to represent business concepts and processes. Together, EPCIS and CBV help businesses achieve superior supply chain visibility and communication by transforming business processes, and this blog post dives into the specifics of how they do this.

## What is EPCIS?

EPCIS is a standard created and maintained by GS1 US, one of the leading global supply chain standards organizations, and it focuses on supply chain visibility. The EPCIS standard helps organizations capture, use, and share information about supply chain events, including the movement and location of goods as they flow through the supply chain. This technology also allows the use of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags and sensors to transmit data, which enhances supply chain visibility.

The use of EPCIS in business is essential. Companies that adopt EPCIS are better able to manage their inventory and keep track of products' movement and location in real-time. EPCIS works by enabling communication between supply chain systems through standardized data exchange with pre-defined attributes for supply chain events. EPCIS standards also allow for reporting of quality information, such as temperature and humidity, which verifies product status and quality.

## What is CBV?

CBV is a set of standard definitions created by the non-profit organization OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) and is designed to help supply chain participants communicate in a uniform way. CBV is used to describe the core terms used for business processes in a standard format, allowing businesses and their partners to speak the same language. CBV deals with processes such as purchases, shipments, and payments, and the standardization of these processes can save businesses time and money by avoiding duplicate or manual work.

One of the significant advantages of CBV is its use of a well-defined, structured format for data representation, which makes it easy for businesses to create and manipulate their data. CBV also allows for flexible and easy-to-understand communications to be passed across the supply chain, increasing communication efficiency and reducing errors. This uniformity and flexibility enable businesses to take full advantage of their existing systems by integrating CBV into their systems' workflows.

## How EPCIS and CBV enhance business processes

When businesses adopt EPCIS and CBV, they gain several advantages in their supply chain operations. Together, these technologies transform a business's operations and processes.

### Enhanced visibility

As mentioned earlier, EPCIS enhances supply chain visibility by providing real-time tracking and reporting of goods. This transparency helps organizations to make informed decisions about the production, shipment, and distribution of goods. By having access to real-time information, businesses are better equipped to handle sudden variations in the supply chain, such as unexpected changes in delivery schedules or disruptions in the chain. With CBV, businesses can easily share and understand supply chain events, making communication and decision-making more informed and effective. The end result is a more transparent and efficient supply chain.

### Improved communication

The integration of EPCIS and CBV improves communication and collaboration across the supply chain, enabling seamless data exchange across multiple systems. By standardizing the terms that businesses use to describe their processes, CBV makes communication more effective, reducing the chance of misunderstandings or misinterpretations. With EPCIS, businesses can track the movement and location of goods and exchange this information with trading partners, so everyone is informed about supply chain events in real-time.

### Simplified processes

The use of EPCIS and CBV also simplifies processes by reducing the need for manual data entry and duplication of workflows. With a standardized format, CBV enables easy data transfer to other systems, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual entries or re-entry of information. Moreover, by having real-time information via EPCIS, businesses can make improvements to their scheduling, production, and delivery, resulting in an optimized supply chain.

### Increased flexibility

EPCIS and CBV provide increased flexibility, letting businesses customize their operations quickly based on their needs. By having a standard set of terms in CBV, businesses can easily incorporate changes into their existing systems without having to rewrite or reconfigure their entire supply chain. EPCIS provides data in a uniform way, which allows businesses to make changes in real-time, adapt to new requirements or products, and respond to sudden disruptions promptly.

### Reduced cost

Finally, businesses save costs using EPCIS and CBV by eliminating errors and inefficiencies. With EPCIS, businesses save on operational costs by reducing manual tracking and errors caused by outdated or limited visibility into the supply chain. CBV saves businesses costs by simplifying processes used for representing business concepts and processes and reducing the use of manual processes. Ultimately, this leads to optimal supply chain operations that can yield more significant revenue growth and cost savings over time.

## Conclusion

Businesses that implement EPCIS and CBV gain a significant competitive advantage through increased transparency, communication, and simplification of processes. The technologies also provide the flexibility to modify business operations to meet changing supply chain requirements while reducing the potential for errors and inefficiencies. With a standardized language used for communicating business concepts and processes, companies can communicate more effectively with trading partners, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation. 

Adopting EPCIS and CBV in your business not only results in better communication and increased visibility into the supply chain, but also enhances profitability and growth by allowing for strategic planning and resource management. In short, transforming your business processes with EPCIS and CBV will allow your business to keep pace with market dynamics and gain a competitive edge in your industry.
